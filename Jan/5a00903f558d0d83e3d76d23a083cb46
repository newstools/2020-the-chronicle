The Chronicle London — Defending champions Saracens could be relegated from the English Premiership if they fail to adhere to the division’s salary cap this season, according to a report on Thursday. The European champions were docked 35 points for this season and fined £5.3 million for breaches of the cap over the past three seasons in November. Saracens boast a star-laden squad, including England captain Owen Farrell, Billy and Mako Vunipola and Mario Itoje. However, no players have left the club since their sanction was announced, meaning they will struggle to meet the £7 million cap for this season. According to a BBC report, the London club have been told that a failure to do so could result in automatic relegation. Earlier this month, Saracens chairperson Nigel Wray announced he would stand down in the wake of the scandal. On the field, Saracens are already facing a relegation battle due to their points deduction, but six wins from their opening eight games of the season have pulled them to within 18 points of safety. They could also still progress to the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup should they beat Racing 92 at home tomorrow. Meanwhile, The Sharks have named a 28-man squad for their Superhero Sunday clash against the Stormers this weekend. A host of big names have been included in the team including the likes of Springbok Rugby World Cup heroes Lukhanyo Am and Makazole Mapimpi as well as new signings Ox Nche and Madosh Tambwe. — Sport24.
