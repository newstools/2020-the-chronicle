The Chronicle EDITOR: A lot of work needs to be done in making sure that every girl has access to sanitary wear. The price of sanitary wear is going up every now and then, forcing some girls to resort to using contraceptives to avoid their periods. Right now sanitary wear is going for $20, and two packets are needed on average. This makes it harder for most girls to save that much money. We have often heard cases of girls who use cow-dung during their cycle. This is not right. Government has to ensure disposable sanitary towels are available in every part of the country. This will minimise cases where girls feel out of place because they do not have the right materials. It will also address issues to do with period shaming, as girls are often laughed at when they spoil their school uniform and chair. Some are humiliated when they walk awkwardly due to use of improper and inconvenient menstrual absorbents such as rags, cow dung. Chofamba.
