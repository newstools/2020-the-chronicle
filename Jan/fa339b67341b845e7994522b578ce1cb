The Chronicle Wayne Chiridza, Showbiz Reporter ZIMDANCEHALL sensation Freeman who is basking in the glory of hit song Ngaibake is topping the nominees list for the 2020 Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA) with six nods for that track. The awards slated for next Saturday, come after a four- year hiatus. Freeman is nominated in the Best male artiste of the year, Best album of the year for Gango, Best Zimdancehall artiste, Best collaboration for Ngaibake which features Alick Macheso, Best video for Ngaibake and Song of the year for that song. Closely following Freeman is Ishan of the Kure fame with five nominations followed by gospel musician Janet Manyowa who has four nominations. After blooming in the industry in just over a year mainly for her collaboration with Winky D on MuGarden, Gemma Griffiths has three nominations mostly emanating from that hit track. DJ Stavo, Tammy Moyo, Takura, Ammara Brown, guitarist Sylent Nqo and Shasha have two nominations each. Representing Bulawayo are the likes of Indosakusa, Sotja Moyo, Ukukhanya Kwezwe, Ndux Jnr, Madlela Skhobokhobo, Msiz’Kay, Busi Ncube and Asaph. Sadly music lovers only have one category where they will have an input in determining the winner which is Song of the year as the rest will be adjudged by the Zima judges.
