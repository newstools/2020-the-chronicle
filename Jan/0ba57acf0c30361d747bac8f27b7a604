I have visited the affected people and everyone was still in shock,” he said. One of the affected villagers, Mr Timothy Mlambo said he was inside his kitchen hut when it suddenly caught fire. “There was a huge bang and the next thing I realised that my hut was on fire.

We lost 20 cattIe in the village including my own five beasts all of which were already in their pens,” he said. Mr Mlambo said they reported the matter to Chief Njelele.
