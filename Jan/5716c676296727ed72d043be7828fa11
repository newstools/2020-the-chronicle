Chief Insp Ndebele warned motorists against driving without licences as it is an offence. He said drivers should desist from speeding and ensure they exercised caution at all times. “People should desist from driving vehicles if they are not licensed drivers as they don’t have the relevant skills and training needed for one to be a driver. By so doing they will also be committing an offence. Drivers are urged to exercise caution at all times and adhere to road regulations,” he said-@DubeMatutu
