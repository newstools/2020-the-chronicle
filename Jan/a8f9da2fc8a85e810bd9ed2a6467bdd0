The Chronicle Cape Town — Novak Djokovic praised his coach Goran Ivanisevic after thrashing Yoshihito Nishioka in the third round of the Australian Open yesterday. The defending champion required only one hour and 25 minutes to beat world No 71 Nishioka 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Djokovic broke once in the first set and twice in the second and third sets to complete the routine victory that saw him serve 17 aces and lose only eight points on serve. His improved serve has been part of his make-up throughout his Australian Open campaign and he took time out to praise Ivanisevic, who joined his coaching set-up last year. “Lots of fun,” the Serb said about the 2001 Wimbledon winner. “Lots of joking around. We speak the same language so we’ve known each other for a very long time. “He was definitely one of my childhood idols. Him coming from Croatia, myself Serbia — a neighbouring country — it’s a very similar culture and the same language basically. “I was training at the academy in Germany where he used to spend some time preparing for Wimbledon which he won in 2001 and I remember hitting a few balls with him and it was a dream come true. “To have him in my box now is wonderful and he brings a good energy to the team and his insight as a coach as well having done it for six-seven years. I’m very grateful to have him.” Meanwhile, Milos Raonic sent sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas tumbling out of the Australian Open in the third round yesterday, with the Greek hotshot powerless against the Canadian’s big serve and pinpoint groundstrokes. Tsitsipas, widely tipped as a challenger to the big guns at the opening Grand Slam of the year, was no match for his experienced opponent, slumping 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 (7/2).- Sport24
