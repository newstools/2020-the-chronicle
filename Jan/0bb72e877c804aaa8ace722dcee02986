The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter TELONE FC head coach Rahman Gumbo conducted the Titans Soccer Academy training course held at Hamilton High School on Tuesday where players aged between 10 and 20 years were taught shooting, passing, dribbling, ball control, teamwork and tackling skills. “We are fortunate to have Rahman Gumbo. He has been training and chatting with the boys and they are very excited to meet one of their heroes in football,” said Titans academy chairman and coach Tinashe Mkoma. The academy is best suited for children that want to learn how to play football. “It is our desire as coaches that as we groom some of these players at an early age they get to another level, preferably at the top. They have to set their own targets that they want to achieve,” Gumbo said. Gumbo was appointed TelOne FC manager in August 2019 in an effort to save the club from relegation, but in vain, as the Wi-Fi Boys were relegated to Division One after finishing 16th in their debut Premier Soccer league campaign last season. Despite Gumbo and his assistants’ failure to save the team from relegation, they have been asked to stay on with the mandate to ensure a quick PSL return.
