The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter OLD Miltonians Rugby Club are conducting trials to build a ladies’ rugby team for participation in the women’s game. Trials will be conducted every Tuesdays and Thursdays by OMs men’s coach Theodore Weale. “In Harare they have such a high number of female rugby players and we thought if they can do it, surely Bulawayo will be at the forefront of supplying female players, especially to the ladies sevens’ team,” Weale said. Precious Marange, Wadzanai Chidawa, Rufaro Tagarira and Constance Ngwende, among others, are some of the prominent female rugby players based in Harare who play for the Lady Cheetahs. The Lady Cheetahs struggled in the Africa Sevens Women’s tournament in November 2019, finishing eighth out of 12 teams and winning just one game. Weale said they looked at how other sporting codes managed to introduce and convince women to join their sport. “We contacted a few people from other sporting codes as we wanted to know what strategies were used to persuade ladies to join. We want to demystify the belief that rugby is a men’s game and is rough,” he said.
