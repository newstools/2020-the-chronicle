The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter TWO Bulawayo men who are serving a 10 months prison term for robbery have been arrested for allegedly fatally assaulting a stranger before robbing him of a cellphone worth $1 000. They allegedly committed the crime before going to prison. Junior Praise Ndlovu (18) of Emakhandeni suburb and Samuel Nyamunga (21) of New Lobengula suburb allegedly hit the deceased whose name and residential address were not mentioned in court twice on the head. Ndlovu and Nyamunga were not asked to plead to murder when they appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Lizwe Jamela. They were remanded in custody to January 24. Mr Jamela advised them to apply for bail at the High Court. Prosecuting, Mr Terrence Chakabuda said on November 15 last year at around 6PM, the deceased was walking along a footpath near Luveve High School in Luveve suburb when he was approached by Ndlovu and Nyamunga. “One of the accused persons produced an axe and ordered the now deceased to comply with their demands. The accused persons started to search the deceased but he resisted prompting one of them to hit him twice on the head with the back of the axe,” said Mr Chakabuda. The deceased fell on the ground, the men took away a Samsung cellphone and went away leaving him for dead. He was taken to Mpilo Central Hospital but died while receiving treatment on November 29. Ndlovu and Nyamunga were arrested on Monday this week in prison.-@zinyuke98
