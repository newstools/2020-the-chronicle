The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Young Mighty Warriors left for Gaborone yesterday ahead of the women’s Under-17 World Cup qualifier against Botswana tomorrow night. The girls had been in camp at Eveline High School in Bulawayo for the past two weeks and the squad of 30 players was trimmed to 18 on Tuesday. Experienced goalkeeper Tariro Chirume, who did duty for the Under-20 national side at last year’s Cosafa tournament, will captain the side. The duo of Elice Moyo and Lorraine Mpasi, who had struggled attaining travel documents, are expected to lead the line. The girls’ preparations for this encounter suffered a setback, as some of them spent a considerable amount of time at the passport office seeking travel documents. This even forced the team to delay its departure for Botswana by two days. “Besides the passport issue, our other problem was that players trickled into camp at different times, as some were still on holiday. However, I am happy with the way the girls have adapted to our training methods in the time we had together,” said coach Garthly Chipuka. “We are going there to compete. Honestly, we don’t know anything about Botswana in terms of how they play, but we understand they have been in camp for a long time. Most of the girls have not played under floodlights, which is a worry for us, but we hope the girls are up for the challenge.” Chipuka is also hoping they get to play on an artificial turf because he does not think his players are fit enough to last a full match on natural grass.
