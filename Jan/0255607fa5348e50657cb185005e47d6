The Chronicle United States — Friends, colleagues and fans mourned Kobe Bryant as federal investigators sifted through the wreckage of the helicopter crash that killed the basketball legend and eight other people, hoping to find clues to what caused the accident that stunned the world. Bryant (41) was traveling on Sunday with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other passengers and crew when the Sikorsky S-76 slammed into a rugged hillside in thick fog in Calabasas, northwest of LA. There were no survivors. A five-time NBA champion for his only team, the LA Lakers, and a double Olympic gold medalist, Bryant was widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players in history. He was traveling on his private helicopter from Orange County, where he lived, to his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks where his daughter was set to play. Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told a Press conference that investigators would remain at the site of the crash throughout the week to collect evidence. “It was a pretty devastating accident scene,” she said, adding that the wreckage was strewn across about 600 feet (180 metres). “We will be here about five days on scene to collect perishable evidence,” she said.  — AFP.
