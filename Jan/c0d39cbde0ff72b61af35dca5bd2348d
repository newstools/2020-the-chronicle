The Chronicle Eddie Chikamhi, Harare Bureau ZIMBABWEAN midfielder Tafadzwa Rusike has crossed the floor in Zambia to join the country’s Super League football champions ZESCO United on a two-year contract. The club’s chief executive Richard Mulenga revealed yesterday that they have reached an agreement with the 30-year-old, who has been in the books of rivals Zanaco for the past two seasons. Mulenga said in a statement that the Ndola-based club was delighted to have Rusike as an addition to their attacking arsenal. ZESCO have won the last three league titles in Zambia to take their tally to eight. The side have participated regularly in the CAF interclub competitions in the last decade, with four Champions League appearances and three in the Confederation Cup. “ZESCO United Football Club wishes to announce the signing of Zimbabwean international midfielder, Tafadzwa Paul Rusike, on a two-year contract. “It is with great excitement that we announce the signing of Tafadzwa Rusike on a two-year contract. Rusike is a quality player whom we expect to add great value to ZESCO United Football Club,” Mulenga said. Rusike is expected to join the club this month subject to medical examinations.

ZESCO United is a fantastic club that has dominated the Zambian league for some time now and they are one of the big teams in Africa.
