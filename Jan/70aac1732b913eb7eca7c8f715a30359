The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly destroying his sister’s property worth $270 during an early morning rampage. Nkosana Mpofu (39) from Old Lobengula suburb allegedly damaged Ms Sibongile Ngwenya (36)’s burglar bar and door with an axe after being denied entry into the house. The court heard that Mpofu’s body was shaking when he visited Ms Ngwenya at around 2AM and knocked on her window stating that he has been sent by his father in a dream to perform rituals at her place. Mpofu pleaded not guilty to malicious damage to property before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove. He was remanded in custody to January 10 for continuation of trial. Prosecuting, Mr Stewart Madzore said Mpofu committed the offence on December 13 last year. “The accused person came to the complainant’s house at around 2AM while she was asleep and knocked on the window requesting the complainant to open the door for him. The complainant refused to open the door and the accused person took an axe and broke it down. The accused person acted unlawfully,” he said. The matter was reported to police leading to Mpofu’s arrest. — @sharonbuwe
