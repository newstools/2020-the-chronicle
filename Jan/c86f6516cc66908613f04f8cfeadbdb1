The Chronicle EDITOR: We, at Africa Albida Tourism, the hospitality group that operates The Boma-Dinner & Drum Show, are concerned that an article published in Chronicle on Wednesday, January 22, 2020 implies game meat served there may not be not ethically sourced. In light of this we would like to clarify that all game meat served at The Boma-Dinner & Drum Show in Victoria Falls is sourced legally and ethically. It is either bought from registered hunters in Zimbabwe or imported from South Africa. Marianne Betts, Group PR Officer, Africa Albida Tourism, Victoria Falls.
