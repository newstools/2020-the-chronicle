The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A HERDSMAN from Binga, Innocent Zulu (19) has appeared in court for allegedly having sexual intercourse with his girlfriend (14). Zulu, of Muzamba Manjoro village in Binga, was a herdsman at Dundubala village in Insuza. He pleaded guilty to a charge of having sexual intercourse with a minor when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Lizwe Jamela. He was remanded to Tuesday on $200 bail. Prosecuting, Mr Terrence Chakabuda said sometime in November last year the man proposed love to the minor. “During the same month on an unknown date during the night, the accused person took the complainant to his house where they had sex once,” said the prosecutor. The complainant allegedly went home and told no one about the sexual encounter. The matter allegedly came to light when the complainant’s mother received a tip off from some neighbours that her daughter was in a love affair with the accused person. “She asked the complainant about the alleged love affair and the girl confirmed that it was true and that the two had sex once with her consent,” Mr Chakabuda said. The matter was reported to the police leading to Zulu’s arrest.-@zinyuke98
