It shows that I’ve been working hard as I’m getting recognition.  It also shows my growth as an artist. ‘‘The Zim Hop award still shows my growth as I’m making my mark on Zimbabwean Hip Hop platform,” he said. The year saw the artiste performing outside Bulawayo as he wants to spread his music and expand to other regions. “2019 was good as we were pushing the Msiz’Kay brand to other parts as I performed in Gwanda, Harare and other places outside of the city which was a blessing for me just to be out there,” Msiz’Kay said. “I have faced hardships due to our current situation but it means working harder. I’m happy about 2019 as I got to grow and expand myself and as a Zimbabwean I’m just working hard towards my goals and trying each day to be better,” he said.
