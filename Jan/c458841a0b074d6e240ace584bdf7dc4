The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter TWENTY-FIVE players were selected into the Cheetahs sevens national rugby team after trials ended at the Machinery Exchange Stadium in Harare at the weekend. The trials brought together players from around the country for an opportunity to claim a spot in the national side. Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board spokesperson Simba Dangah said the selected players will go into camp on February 3 to prepare for the Chile-Uruguay World Rugby Series. “Players that will not make it into the traveling squad will be absorbed by the Cheetahs Academy team, Goshawks. The young developing players will be kept together as the academy side and will provide the Cheetahs with a pool of players to select from going forward,” Dangah said. Zimbabwe will join Brazil, Chile, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Tonga, Uganda, Uruguay and three invitational teams Colombia, Mexico and Paraguay at the World Rugby Series whose first-leg starts on February 15.
