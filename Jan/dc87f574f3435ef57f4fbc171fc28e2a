The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly threatening to assault his niece with a brick after she told her mother that he was forcing her to go to bed without eating supper. Handsome Sibanda (30) of Makokoba suburb allegedly threatened to hit Kimberly Sibanda (6) of the same suburb. Sibanda was not asked to plead to physical abuse when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Lizwe Jamela. He was remanded out of custody on free bail to January 13. Prosecuting, Mr Terrence Chakabuda said on December 18 at around 8PM, Sibanda arrived home drunk and ordered his niece to go to bed. “The complainant told her mother that the accused person had ordered her to go and sleep. The complainant’s mother confronted the accused person and asked him why the minor was supposed to go to bed without eating,” he said. This did not go well with Sibanda who allegedly picked a brick and threatened to hit the girl for reporting him to her mother. “The accused person was blocked by the complainant’s father from hitting her,” said Mr Chakabuda. The matter was reported to the police by Sibanda’s younger brother and this led to his arrest. — @zinyuke98
