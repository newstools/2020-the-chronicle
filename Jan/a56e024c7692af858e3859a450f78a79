The Chronicle Daniel Chigunwe, Harare Bureau Miners do not need to carry machetes and police will ensure that the weapons are not carried in public, Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister Kazembe Kazembe has said. Addressing hundreds of Zanu-PF supporters in Mazowe Central at the 2018 election victory celebrations for Ward 10 councilor Cde Chakabvepi Chinhema, Minister Kazembe said mining activities should be carried out within the confines of the law. “If you have a machete, go and bury it underground because the police will leave no stone unturned to make sure that machetes have disappeared from the people,” he said. “People should be organised and carry out their mining activities with respect of the law. Where is this butchering coming from? So, I say if there are those here with machetes be warned that the long arm of the law will catch up with you soon.” Cde Kazembe condemned attacks on the police force by machetes gangs, saying police had already arrested the gang behind the death of an officer in Kadoma. “There is no way you can run and hide from the law here in Zimbabwe, it could be just for a short while, but you will definitely be caught,” he said. “As I speak, those who killed the police officer, nine of them have since been arrested and we are only left with a few and they are going to be caught.  When the police are on duty, let them perform their mandate. Do not harass them.”
