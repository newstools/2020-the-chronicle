Mpilo Central Hospital clinical director Dr Solwayo Ngwenya said the hospital was already implementing the new user fees. He said hospitals user fees had become ridiculously low making it difficult for them to offer services. “The fees had become subeconomic as patients were paying as little as $17 consultation fees for example.” A health practitioner who preferred not to be named said reintroducing maternity fees will affect gains made in fighting maternal deaths. “I think it’s a retrogressive step. All the gains that were made by allowing mothers free access to ante-natal and post -natal health care have been reversed. Most women will now be forced to give birth at home thereby risking their lives and that of their babies. “Recently we were celebrating that the mortality rates had dropped by 29 percent to 462 per 100 000 live births. This gain will definitely be reversed by the reintroduction of maternity fees. There is need for Government to re-visit the issue of maternity fees to save mothers and their babies,” said the practitioner.-@nqotshili
