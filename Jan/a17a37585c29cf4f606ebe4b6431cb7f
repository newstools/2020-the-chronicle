The Chronicle Rutendo Ngara, Chronicle Reporter POLICE in Nkayi district have banned the carrying of machetes, axes, knobkerries, swords, daggers, knives, catapults and other traditional weapons for three months. The Officer Commanding Nkayi district, Chief Superintendent Mthokozisi Manzini-Moyo said the ban is with effect from January 15 to April 15. “According to section 4 of the Maintenance of Peace and Order Act, chapter 11:23 I do hereby prohibit carrying of the aforementioned dangerous items for a period of three months. “Authorities do believe that carrying of these weapons in a public place, public thoroughfare or public display has resulted in an increase in cases of assault, attempted murder and murder,” said Chief Supt Manzini-Moyo.

The areas which border Nkayi district are Kana river to the North, Shangani River to the south, a grid at the 80-kilometre peg along the Nkayi-Lupane (Fighting Road) road and back to Kana river.  Last week, Police Commissioner General Godwin Matanga said prohibition orders would soon be issued, especially around mining areas to curb violence by machete gangs.-@missngara
