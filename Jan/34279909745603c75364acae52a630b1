The Chronicle Have you ever wondered why a great number of people seem to have their birthdays in September? Well, apparently it’s because thousands of couples attempt to conceive a child during this week of the year – with today (January 2) being the most popular time for people to try for a baby. According to data analysed from the UK government’s live births database, there’s one day each year when the most babies are born and that’s September 26. So if you work backwards from that date, you’ll see that January 2 is exactly 38 weeks before then – which is the average length of a pregnancy. And as well as a popular day to conceive, there’s also a popular time for would-be parents to have sex . Of the 2 139 people ChannelMum.com surveyed, 71 percent confessed that shortly after 10:30pm (10:36pm) is the most common time for them to strip off under the sheets with their partner. The study also found that men and women are becoming increasingly willing to go to any lengths necessary in order to conceive. Among the weirder things they had tried, some people claimed they thought wearing frozen underpants, giving up alcohol and keeping their socks on during sex would help them have a baby. Speaking to the Daily Star, ChannelMum founder, Siobhan Freegard, said: “Falling pregnant isn’t always easy so couples who have been trying a while will attempt almost anything to help. “While there isn’t much medical science to back up these tips, our members swear they have all helped and we have hundreds of bouncing new babies to prove it.” She added: “As long as you have fun trying, it’s always worth giving it a go.” — AFP
