The swimming gala started on Wednesday, with Harare, Matabeleland, Mashonaland Country Districts, Manicaland and Crocs taking part.

In third place were Mashonaland Country Districts with 119 points followed by Crocs with 57 points and Manicaland with 42 points. Harare were the overall winners and dominated in the female reces while Matabeleland dominated in the male category. Harare’s female swimmers that dominated their respective age groups included emerging stars Donata Katai (16) and Paige van der Westhuizen (17), with Vhenekai Dhemba (14) and Tanatsirwa Chitsururu (14) winning most of the races they took part in while Matabeleland’s Rollo Riana (17) clinched several gold medals including the 100m breaststroke and 50m backstroke.

Matabeleland Amateur Swimming Board spokesperson Thomas Werret said close to 200 swimmers took part in the gala. “Only Midlands failed to field a team for this event. Swimmers managed to post good times, with some attaining personal bests and also meeting qualifying times for forthcoming international events. Zimbabwe is heading for Botswana for the Cana Zone IV championships next month and this was an opportunity for swimmers selected for the event to prepare,” said Werret. — @innocentskizoe
