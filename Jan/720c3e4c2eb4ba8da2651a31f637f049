The Chronicle Botswana’s court of appeal yesterday dismissed an opposition bid to challenge election results that enabled President Mokgweetsi Masisi to secure a five-year term. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) swept to a crushing majority in the October 23 general elections, securing 38 out of 57 seats in parliament. Runner-up Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), which won only 15 seats, filed a lawsuit shortly after the announcement, citing alleged irregularities. “We have no jurisdiction to entertain these appeals,” head judge Ian Kirby ruled yesterday, speaking on behalf of the five-member panel that oversaw the case. The court of appeal had agreed to hear the opposition earlier this month after a lower court rejected their petition for lack of evidence. The verdict has now drawn a line under the case. UDC spokesman Moeti Mohwasa would not comment on the judges’ decision. “We have nothing to say at the moment until we study the ruling,” he told AFP. Botswana, famed for its diamonds and wildlife, is hailed by many in Africa as a beacon of stability and democracy.-AFP.
