The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter QUEENS Sports Club gets to host a first-class cricket fixture for the first time this season when Tuskers clash with Rhinos in a four-day match that gets underway this morning. Last season no Logan Cup fixture took place in Bulawayo, with the city only hosting 50-over fixtures. The match between Tuskers and Rhinos was meant to be played at the beginning of this month at Takashinga Cricket Club, but was postponed for logistical reasons. Bulawayo cricket fans have a great opportunity to watch some of the national team players that were not selected for Zimbabwe’s Test series against Sri Lanka. Brian Chari, Christopher Mpofu, John Nyumbu, Luke Jongwe, Cunningham Ncube and Ernest Masuku are some of the players Tuskers will be banking on as they seek their first win this season. Tuskers are presently at the bottom of the log with zero points, having lost the two matches they have played in the Logan Cup. They lost their opening match of the season to Mountaineers by 244 runs and fell by seven wickets to Eagles. Both matches were played in Harare. Rhinos, on the other hand, have posted one win from their three matches. They lost to Eagles and Mountaineers before hammering Rangers by 112 runs. Rhinos will look to the likes of Peter Moor, Tendai Chisoro, Neville Madziva, Brandon Mavuta, Remembrance Nyathi and Nyasha Mayavo to steer them to their second win of the season. – @Mdawini_29
