The Chronicle Walter Mswazie in Masvingo A 47-YEAR-OLD Chivi man allegedly sat on top of his sleeping 101-year-old grandfather and suffocated him for refusing to pray for him, police have confirmed. David Chokureva of Mhosva Village under Headman Chipindu allegedly forced open the door to Maribha Chaka’s bedroom in the wee hours of the night. He attempted to wake up the elderly man who was fast asleep together with his wife but he did not respond. This angered Chokureva and he allegedly sat on top of his victim, weighing heavily on the centenarian leading to his death by suffocation. Masvingo police spokesperson Chief Inspector Charity Mazula said the incident occurred on Tuesday at around 1am. She said the suspect was arrested and is assisting police with investigations. She said the body of the deceased was taken to Chivi District Hospital mortuary for post-mortem. “I can confirm receiving a murder report involving a man who is suspected to be mentally challenged,” said Chief Insp Mazula. She said Chokureva who lived some distance away from his grandfather’s homestead asked his cousin, Mr Alfred Samanyika of Shangwa Village to accompany him to the elderly man’s homestead. The two found Chaka and his 92-year-old wife fast asleep. Chokureva knocked on the couple’s bedroom door demanding that the elderly man should wake up and pray for him but received no response. This could have angered Chokureva who forced open the door to the couple’s bedroom. “He sat on his grandfather while his wife and the cousin who had remained outside watched,” she said. Chief Insp Mazula said Chokureva rushed outside and told his cousin that he had caused the death of Chaka. A report was made to officers at Chivi police station who attended the scene and took the body to the hospital mortuary for post-mortem leading to the suspect’s arrest.
