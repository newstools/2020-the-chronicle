The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent HIP-HOP sensation Ti Gonzi, who wrapped up last year in style by walking away with three gongs at the Zimbabwe Hip Hop Music Awards, is topping the 2020 Changamire Festival Awards with 11 nominations followed by King 98 who has nine. The hip hop awards ceremony which is in its fifth year has been slated for next Wednesday at Dreams nightclub in Harare with Zambian musician Mic Burner also billed to perform. Ti Gonzi is nominated for Best Male, Best Collaboration, Best Hip Hop Verse, Best Hip Hop Chorus and twice in the Song of the Year category for his hit Kure with Ishan and his single Enzo nemaPumacol among other categories. Closely following TiGonzi is 21-year-old King 98 followed by Hillzy with eight nominations and hip hop artiste Kikky Badass with six nominations. Coco WeAfrica, Stunner and Benvolio R.T are all tied on five nominations. At the awards ceremony which seeks to recognise up-and-coming talent, Bulawayo is highly represented by Asaph who has four nods and songstress Blaq Diva Quin, producer Larynx and duo DJ’s Motion Entertainment. Founder of the awards, Jackson “Zimboy” Muchechetere, who is behind the Changamire Hip Hop Festival, said all is in place for the awards ceremony which has grown tremendously. “When we started the Changamire awards in 2016, we only had 10 categories and now we have 30 categories covering almost every Hip-hop genre showing how much the event has grown,” Zimboy said. “Changamire is however, based on artistes who perform at the festivals or are directly affiliated with the Changamire festival so we look into prominent artists who are really making a mark in the streets.” Below is a full list of the nominees; BEST MALE Takura, TiGonz, Stunner, Crooger, King 98 (S.A), Asaph BEST FEMALE Shashl, Natasha Muz, Kikky Badass, Lua Peris (Gweru), Cerise West, Tashamiswa BEST NEWCOMER Tanto Wavie, Benvolio R.T, King 98, Ishan, N.T.A, Hillzy SONG OF THE YEAR Gokamu – Coco WeAfrica, Zvemoyo – Takura, Famba murima – T Gonz, Kure – Ishan ft T Gonz, Mabazooker, Enzo nemaPumacol – T Gonz, Tungamirai – Crooger ft Bryan K BEST ALBUM Ghetto Chronicles – Stunner, Francesca – King 98, Boo Tape 1 Mysteries of a toxic love – Benvolio R.T, Fresh Prince of Senga – Fetty Swazy , Something From Nothing – Dj Steers, Queen’s Speech – Natasha Muz BEST FREESTYLE Kikky Badass, Phreshy, Tashamiswa, Natasha Muz, Slinx, Blaq Diva Quin BEST PRODUCER Jamal, Dj Tamuka, Billberry, Chiwedah, Larynx, GtBeats BEST COLLABORATION Tungamirai-Crooger ft Bryan K, Kure-Ishan ft T Gonz, Wacko -King 98 ft Nasty C,Layliz, Special meat- Tricky j ft Tehn Diamond, Tv room – Hillzy ft Gary Mapanzure, Huruwek- Stunner ft T Gonz CHANGAMIRE BIGGEST BOSSES Donchichi, Lord Paul, Uncle Rolland, Chimpah, Power Circle, Lusha MOST RELEVANT CLUB DJ Royal Djs, Raydizz, Dj Crocx, Selekta Base, Dj Mutu, Dj Stavo HIP HOP PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR Stunner, Shashl, Dj Stavo, Kikky Badass, Ray Vines, Selekta Base BEST DANCE Dony & Rony, Flip Floppers, Magnetic Force, Lisa Tanaka, D Boi Mash, Elpee Dual Choreography BEST MODEL/VIXEN Nazira, Lyndy, Natasha Andrews, Kayla, Yellow Chyna (Mutare), Tatalisa BEST HIP HOP VERSE Mabazooker 1st verse- T Gonz, Gokum 1st verse-Coco WeAfrica, Kure Last verse – T Gonz, Bho Zvekuti 1st verse -Tashamiswa, Shoko 1st verse -King 98 ft Exq, Don Gaya 1st verse-gTBeats BEST HIP HOP CHORUS Rich Nusty- Milk the cows, Tanto Wavie- John Chibadura, Tashamiswa ft Asaph – Bho Zvekuti, Takura- Zvemoyo, Hillzy Ft Garry Mapanzure – TV Room, Ishan ft T Gonz – Kure BEST CO-ORDINATED HIP HOP EVENT Dj Stavo & Friends, Ivyson Tour, Francesca Album Launch, Legacy Tour, Benvolio RT Album Launch, Afternoon ChillOut (Gweru) BEST PERFORMANCE ACT T Gonz, King 98, Alchemy, Kikky Badass, Natasha Muz, Ammara Brown BEST HIP HOP GROUP/DUO Motion Entertainment, Team Bho, Young Games Entertainment, Extreme Ent (Selekta Base & Shashl), Hillzy & Garry Mapanzure, Hip Hop YekuGhetto BEST ALTERNATIVE Alchemy, Ninja kid, Legion, Ammara Brown, Garry Mapanzure, Coco WeAfrica BEST BRAND SUPPORTING HIP HOP Chicken Hut, Tecno Mobile, Impala Car Rental, Spinalong, Unplugged zw, Events Hub BEST DIASPORA Mogba The Charmer (Dubai), Yung Parker (China), Hillzy (SA), Benvolio RT (SA), Fucci (China), Briss Mbada (S.A) BEST HIP HOP BRAND Mahein Glam (Gweru), Mukukuzvi, Dubbz Ent (Gweru), Chasers,l Empire 263, The Ninjas (Chinhoyi) BEST CLUB SUPPORTING HIP HOP Club Connect (Harare), Woods Sensation (HRE), Pabloz (Gweru), Bar Code (Mutare), Pabloz (Harare), Liquids (Masvingo) BEST VIDEO Don Gaya – gTBeats, Zindoga- Alchemy, Wacko – King 98 ft Nasty C & Layliz -Gokamu – Coco WeAfrica, Bata pasi – Kikky Badass, John Chibadura – Tanto Wavie MOST RELEVANT STUDIO No Limits-Jamal, Young Games Ent-Quozor, Mula Nation-Scripmula, Military Touch-Dj Tamuka & Rodney, Big Bass Entertainment, VGM – Mars on the Beat BEST HIP HOP HUSTLE Ray Vines, Mupsy, Selekta Base, Ric Chasers, Dj Stavo, Crooger, King 98 BEST LYRICIST Asaph, Sway The 3rd, Benvolio R.T, Trey XL, Hillzy, T Gonz BEST FASHION DESIGNER/ORIGINATOR Ric Chasers, Dee Suits Studios, Nigel-Zim Apparels, Cynthia – Mahein Glam, Marshy-Wear Your Car, King Casheyz-Royal Blood BEST UNDERGROUND Funky Fresh, Dave The H town Mitch, Da Juice (lee Ivy), K Slick, Chapter, Tiddy, Dj Scar, Rich Nusty, B Rock, Slinx PEOPLE’S CHOICE Natasha Muz, Stunner, Crooger, Coco WeAfrica, Ti Gonz, Kikky Badass, King 98, Asaph, Hillzy, Takura. – @mthabisi_mthire.
