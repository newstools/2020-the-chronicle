The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Under-17 women’s football team arrives in Bulawayo today ahead of their World Cup qualifier second-leg encounter against Botswana at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. The Young Mighty Warriors were humiliated 5-0 in the first-leg in Gaborone a fortnight ago, a result that cost the scalp of coach Garthly Chipuka. Langton Giwa is the new new man in charge of the girls. Giwa boasts of vast experience in women’s football, having previously worked with junior women’s national teams. Ennie Konje and Boga Ndebele retained their role as assistant coaches. The Under-17 side has been camped at the Zifa Village in Mount Hampden just outside Harare preparing for the crucial return leg and will leave Harare for Bulawayo this morning. Team manager Fizo Sibanda said: “We have some additions to the side that did battle in the first-leg. The confidence being shown by the girls is good and l am sure they will give a good account of themselves come match day. At the beginning of this camp we had 32 players, but we have since trimmed them to 22 and the final 18 will be named shortly.” Zifa announced that entry to Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday will be free in a bid to boost attendance and support for the girls. The Under-17 girls will each receive $500 in appearance fees courtesy of Herentals Group of Schools. Herentals also donated groceries, $15 000 for the girls’ camping expenses and also unveiled a $45 000 school fees scholarship package. The fund becomes operational from the player’s current level up to A-Level. For the national team girls to benefit, they have to enrol with a Herentals school anywhere in the country. – @innocentskizoe
