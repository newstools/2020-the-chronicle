The Chronicle South Sudan’s President Slva Kiir is expected to close this year’s national dialogue conference that recommended a two term presidential limit. The 15-day conference was boycotted by First Vice-President Riek Machar and key opposition figures.
Dr Machar cited “reservations due to lack of implementation of some provisions of the 2018 revitalised peace agreement”. The national dialogue was aimed at discussing solutions to end political and communal violence in the country.
It also sought ways of addressing the fear of political domination by some ethnic groups and agree on resource sharing among all groups. Participants in this year’s conference recommended a two five-year term limit for the president starting from the next elections. They also recommended that regional state governors should serve for only two consecutive terms of five years. The 518 delegates, representing 80 counties from across the country and representatives of the different political parties, recommended that the country should adapt a presidential system with two deputies to the president – one of whom must be a woman. The conference also recommended the establishment of more regional states. — Reuters
