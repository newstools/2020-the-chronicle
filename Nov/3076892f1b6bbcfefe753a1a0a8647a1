FORMER Bulawayo Publicity Association (BPA) director Mrs Valerie Bell has died. She died yesterday morning at Edith Duly Old People’s Home in Bulawayo. Speaking by telephone, BPA director Mr Moreblessings Tshuma confirmed the death of Mrs Bell. “I can confirm the passing on of Mrs Bell. It happened this morning at Edith Duly Old People’s Home where she has been staying,” he said. Mrs Bell retired from the BPA last year. “She has not been good in terms of her health; she’s been on and off and has not been well for the past week or two,” said Mr Tshuma. Following her retirement, she has been involved in the activities of the association on a consultancy basis. Mrs Bell joined the association in 1966 before becoming its director in 1991 and has been a respected member of the association. BPA was established in 1932 to promote and publicise all aspects of the City of Bulawayo and surrounding districts in commerce and industry, tourism, sport, arts and culture. The association provides a personal information service to inquiries and a place of first contact for visitors to the city. — @okazunga
