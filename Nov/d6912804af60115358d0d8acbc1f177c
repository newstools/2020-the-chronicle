PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has congratulated the Zimbabwe Chevrons for their sensational win over hosts Pakistan in the third and final ODI in which Blessing Muzarabani was the tourists’ star man. In his congratulatory message, President Mnangagwa who saw off the team as they left for Pakistan, said the national cricket team has made the country very proud with the win. “Congratulations to @zimcricket for a fantastic win this evening. You have made your country proud,” wrote President Mnangagwa on his Twitter account. In a game with two centuries, two five-fors, a tie, and a Super Over,Blessing Muzarabani made all the difference as Zimbabwe almost fluffed their lines before pulling off a win in the third and final ODI via the one-over shootout, according to a match report by Cricinfo. In normal time, Muzarabani took a five-for. He was at it again afterwards, picking up two wickets to give his batsmen a three-run chase, which they pulled off. That the match ended in a tie was down to Pakistan — thanks to Babar Azam’s 125 and Wahab Riaz’s 52 — dragging their chase of 279 deep, and the Zimbabweans losing their composure towards the death. Sikandar Raza, who later scored the winning run, dropped a straightforward chance in the deep off Riaz, and a Tendai Chisoro misfield let the final ball through for four, levelling the scores. The door seemed to have been shut on Zimbabwe there, but Muzarabani ensured a first win for Zimbabwe in 11 ODIs, and Pakistan’s first defeat in ten. Pakistan’s record chasing over 250 hasn’t been the best of late: they have won just four of the last 23. But on an excellent strip for batting, they would have fancied their chances though the target wasn’t small. Muzarabani, however, had other ideas, knocking back Imam-ul-Haq’s off stump in the first over, while Richard Ngarava removed Haider Ali and Fakhar Zaman in quick succession. Pakistan, like Zimbabwe earlier, had lost the top three in no time.
