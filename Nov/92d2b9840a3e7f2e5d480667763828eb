The deal also includes four sets of training kit made up of neon, orange, red and peppermint green, accompanied by black shorts. <img class="alignnone wp-image-520040 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Bosso-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Bosso-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Bosso-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The peppermint training kit, which looks bluish, has already raised debate in social media, with the club’s followers associating the colour with perennial rivals Dynamos. The training kit will also be used for warm-ups. <img class="alignnone wp-image-520042 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Bosso-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Bosso-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Bosso-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The traveling kit, which the technical team will also wear on the bench, comprises white golf shirts, with a splash of grey as well as black golf tops. The tops can either be worn with black tracksuit pants or black shorts. – @ZililoR
