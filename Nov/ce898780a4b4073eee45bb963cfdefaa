THE Matabeleland North Volleyball Association will tomorrow (Friday) hold their elective congress at Mhlahlandlela Government complex in Bulawayo. Chairman Sifiso Buhlungu is set to retain his post unopposed with vacancies in the vice-chairman, secretary general and committee members’ slots set to be filled. Speaking ahead of the congress Buhlungu said all was in place for the meeting. “People wanted continuity but our vice chair, secretary general and all committee members requested to step down due to other commitments. We will therefore have new members filling those positions. We are looking forward to setting up structures,” he said. Matabeleland North has not had meaningful volleyball action over the years but work is being done on upgrading the sport. Before Covid-19 wreaked havoc and iced all sporting activities in the country, the association was working towards the creation of a league that will feature teams from the province’s districts. At the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) annual general meeting held in Matabeleland North early this year, it was resolved that all provinces should adopt beach and sitting volleyball. “Schools particularly are our target as we aim to grow beach and sitting volleyball in the province. We want to start introducing it at school level where we have targeted the Under-14 age group before we move to the senior teams,” Buhlungu said. He said they were working tirelessly to ensure that Matabeleland North becomes a force to reckon with in volleyball circles. — @innocentskizoe
