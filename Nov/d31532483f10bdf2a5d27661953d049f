The Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA) are only a few days away and many gospel music fans are asking each other the likely winner of the Outstanding Gospel Artiste/Act category. Gospel music is very popular in Bulawayo as the city’s artistes excel in that genre. Those nominated in the category are Mai Mwamuka of the Panenyasha fame, Touya Ishe hit-maker Minister Lindani, up-and-coming talented Blessing Mokoena and Harvest Music, a gospel outfit known for staging splended shows. <img class="wp-image-482345 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Mai-Mwamuka22.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Mai-Mwamuka22.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Mai-Mwamuka22-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mai Mwamuka Voting lines will close on November 22 for all categories except for five categories whose voting will run until November 28, the awards ceremony day. Commenting on the awards, Mai Mwamuka said the nomination came as a surprise and to celebrate, she will be dropping visuals for her latest single titled Nhasi Ndakura. “I remember weeks back, I checked with my team if the registration date (for BAA entries) had closed and I was amazed to know that I had been nominated. I’m so thankful to all the supporters who made this possible. May God bless you for supporting gospel music,” Mai Mwamuka said. She said to reward fans, she will release visuals for the hit song Pane Nyasha and also Nhasi Ndakura on Saturday.
Mokoena said he was honoured to be nominated. “I’m extremely honoured to be nominated as music for me is a calling. I never set out on this journey with the intention of winning awards or popularity but to tell the Christian story and change lives,” he said. Mokoena said just being nominated alone is a win for him. “To me, the award has already been won because being regarded as outstanding and in the top four of a category is a win,” he said. Minister Lindani who is based in Kwekwe said 2020 has favoured her as her music is being appreciated in various parts of the country. “The nomination has motivated me to work harder and do more. The pandemic came up with a ban of all our gatherings but I continued marketing my music and clothing stuff which got overwhelming support,” said Lindani. — @mthabisi_mthire.
