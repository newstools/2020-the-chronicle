THE Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo Province successfully held a refresher course for club representatives at Raylton Sports Club at the weekend. The course was aimed at preparing for the return of the game post-lockdown. Netball is among sports classified as high risk by the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) and has not been given permission to resume activities. Acting Bulawayo Zina chairman Joseph Nkomazana said: “The refresher course went well. We had about 42 participants that is coaches, umpires and players. We talked more about the effects of the Covid-19 and how the girls should handle themselves during this pandemic. “The course managed to rebuild the netball zeal as we shared information on what needs to be done for compliance in order for the game to resume. “We also touched on the way forward if we are given the green light to resume our games. On the way forward everyone agreed that as we wait for games to resume the most important issue was to continue having more courses for the benefit of every team. “The other main issue was to upgrade or remind them on other new rules of the netball game.” Zina had already put in place plans to introduce a Division Two league that will feature teams from around Bulawayo before sporting activities were suspended in March after the lockdown was imposed, due to the pandemic. The Division Two league is meant to accommodate and nurture players that can’t make it into Division One and Super League teams. Despite plans for the new league being put on hold, the association is confident it can still be introduced when the go-ahead is given for netball to resume. — @innocentskizoe
