TWO suburbs at Binga centre have gone for two months without water after being disconnected for non-payment.
The Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) supplies bulk water to Binga Rural District Council (BRDC) which then distributes the water to residents. The water authority disconnected a pipe that supplies Emasotsheni and parts of Govera suburbs in September to force council to clear its arrears of more than $1,3 million. The affected residents have resorted to fetching untreated water from Zambezi River risking being attacked by crocodiles or drowning. The council targets to raise $300 000 from the 156 disconnected households but Zinwa has said it can only reconnect water supplies after council has paid half of the amount it owes. Council is now demanding a monthly fixed charged of $583 per household which it says goes towards clearing the Zinwa debt. Binga Residents’ Association administrator Mr Mayasi Mudenda said the affected residents have been without running water since September hence have resorted to using untreated water fetched direct from Zambezi River. “We engaged council over the isssue and council is accusing residents of defaulting in paying water bills,” said Mr Mudenda. Ms Senzeni Munkuli from Emasotsheni suburb said lack of running water was a health time bomb as residents had now resorted to using the bush to relieve themselves. Other suburbs have also been without water for the past week because of a power outage after some electricity poles fell in Bankuli, Saba area. Mr Mudenda said Binga has a perennial challenge with electricity poles that fall during the rainy season. Councillor for Kaani ward which covers Binga Centre, Clr Judith Sibanda said the local authority has been engaging Zinwa over the issue of water diconnections. She said the council is facing financial challenges hence it has failed to clear its arrears. — @ncubeleon
