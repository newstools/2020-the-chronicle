Three Kwekwe teenagers recently reportedly lured a 7-year-old with a $5 note before taking turns to rape the helpless minor. The youths aged 18, 16 and 15 cannot be named. While two of them are still on the run, one of them, the eldest, has been arrested and arraigned before a Kwekwe Magistrate Mrs Sheryl Tembo facing rape charges. He was granted $2 000 bail. He will be back in court on December 3. The State led by Ms Yeukai Mugumba has it that, at a date not known to the State, but between September and October this year, the three teenagers were at their Old Flat in Westend Suburb in Kwekwe. The complainant was playing with her friends when one of the accused called her into the flat and she consented. One of the accused then told her to get into the bedroom and again she complied. He then told her that he would give her a $5 note if she removed her clothes. After she removed her clothes, the accused person went on to rape the juvenile. After the heinous act, he then gave the juvenile the $5 he had promised in an attempt to buy her silence. The other two boys would also reportedly take turns to rape the minor before releasing her. The act reportedly happened on several occasions from September to October. The matter came to light when the juvenile broke the news of the act to her father. The father reported the matter at Amaveni Police Station leading to the arrest of one of the accused whilst the other two are still at large. A medical report presented in court showed that the juvenile has been ‘facing multiple episodes of sexual assault.’
