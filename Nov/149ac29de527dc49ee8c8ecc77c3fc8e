I can’t keep calm as I’m over the moon,” said an excited Awa as she launched the song. “The song is a collaboration between me and my producer, Ghanaian Stallion.

With this song, I want to mark my territory as the Queen of Ndebele rap,” Awa Khiwe said. <img class="size-full wp-image-508380" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Awa-Khiwe-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Awa-Khiwe-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Awa-Khiwe-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Awa Khiwe “On the song, where I praise my rap skill, I also talked about misogyny in rap music. The song seeks to announce my comeback because I haven’t been releasing any music for the past two years.” Ngeke Bengimele, Awa Khiwe said is available on all major digital platforms. She added that she is back full force and will be dropping new projects from the start of next year so as to not starve her fans of quality entertainment. <img class="size-full wp-image-505934" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Awa-Khiwe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Awa-Khiwe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Awa-Khiwe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Awa Khiwe “I want to release as many projects as I can, starting with an EP that will be released next year. The EP will once again be a collaboration between Ghanaian Stallion and I. Ghanaian Stallion is the one who works behind the scenes, working on the beats and mixing my vocals.” All eyes are definitely on her to see if she will get the social media streets buzzing with her creativity and style. – @mthabisi_mthire
