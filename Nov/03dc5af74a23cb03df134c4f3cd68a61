THE trial of the convicted former Midlands Provincial Affairs Minister Jason Machaya and provincial planning officer, Chaisayanyerwa Chibururu and six other Government officials failed to kick off for the third time yesterday. Machaya and Chibururu were back in court yesterday to answer to more charges of illegally allocating State land and this time they were joined by six other Government officials. The duo is already each serving a 30-month prison term for criminal abuse of office after they were in July each sentenced to 48 months imprisonment for criminal abuse but had 18 months suspended on condition of good behaviour. Machaya (68) and Chibururu (50), were convicted of unlawfully allocating about 1 000 stands in Gokwe town.
Yesterday, they were back in court jointly charged with former Midlands and Mashonaland West provincial development co-ordinator Cecilia Chitiyo and five other senior Government officials facing allegations of illegally allocating State land. The other five are Matilda Manhambo (59), Sherpard Marweyi (48), Sifelani Moyo (59), Ethel Mlalazi (65) and Everest Nyamadzawo (33). They appeared before a Beitbridge regional magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje, who has taken over the matter from his Bulawayo counterpart Mrs Sibongile Msipa-Marondedze. The accused are facing charges of illegally allocating more than 11 000 stands to land developers. The trial, which was supposed start yesterday had to be postponed to December 1 after defence lawyers failed to attend court. Mr Andrew Kumire is representing the State.
