Media personality Sizwakele “Zwa” Ndlovu, ZiFM Stereo’s Armad and Patience “Pat” Phiri have been unveiled as this year’s hosts of the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAAs) that are taking place tomorrow at the Large City Hall.
Zwa and Armad will be the main stage hosts while Phiri will be the anchor of the awards. Welcoming nominees on the red carpet will be Breeze FM radio producer and presenter, Tinashe “Sycho” Okamaskhosana and Onvi TV presenter Thembie “Ntie” Phiedarh. This year, according to event organisers, there will be no fashion police, but this does not mean people should take chances with their outfits as a fashion review panel will be stationed at the venue. RoilBAAs spokesperson, Nkululeko Nkala said in line with the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based-violence (GBV), they deliberately chose to have women taking the lead in the awards ceremony. <img class="wp-image-519896 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Patience-Phiri.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Patience-Phiri.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Patience-Phiri-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Patience “Pat” Phiri “We’ve entrusted the hosting of the awards to women because they can do it and it’s in line with the 16 days of activism against GBV. They’ve proven beyond doubt that they’re more than capable and this should be the trajectory that we should take in future,” said Nkala. He said preparations for the awards which are in their fourth edition, are going on well as everything seems to be coming together well. On performances, Nkala revealed that there will be a tribute to the late rapper Cal Vin and Iyasa founding member Sibonisiwe “Bonnie” Sithole. <img class="wp-image-519899 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Ahmad.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Ahmad.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Ahmad-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Armad “Everything is in order and we’ve put measures in place to adhere to the Covid-19 regulations. During the ceremony, there’ll be tribute to the late Cal Vin and Bonnie of Iyasa. Artistes will come together and perform a piece for the two as we remember their immense contribution to the arts,” said Nkala. Due to the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, limited tickets have been sold with the rest expected to watch the awards from the comfort of their homes. As such, the awards will be streamed live on the Bulawayo Arts Awards Facebook page as from 6PM tomorrow. Event organisers said tickets are still available for those who want to have a live feel of the event. – @bonganinkunzi
