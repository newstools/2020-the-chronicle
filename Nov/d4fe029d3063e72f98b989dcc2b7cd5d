The Yard proprietor, Tariro “Boss Double” Benza said they had invited Poptain in order to unite artistes and create a networking platform for them all in a quest to revive the Victoria Falls leisure scene. “We are driven by the desire to unify people through entertainment. Bringing in an artiste from out of town exposes them to new crowds while also giving artistes from Vic Falls an opportunity to network. “Healthy competition is then created between the local artistes and those coming from other cities. Ultimately, this will bring out the best in all of them,” said Boss Double. Poptain’s appearance at The Yard will follow that of Hello Mwari hit-maker Jah Master who officially opened the leisure centre. – @mthabisi_mthire
