POLICE in Matabeleland North are appealing for information that may lead to identification of a body of a man that was found dead in Gwampa area along the Bulawayo-Nkayi road. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Chief Inspector Siphiwe Makonese said the body was found in September and has been lying unclaimed in the mortuary. The deceased had no identification documents when the body was found by the roadside. “We are appealing to members of the public to help identify the body of a man believed to be in his late 40s or early 50s. He is of medium build and dark in complexion. The body was discovered in the Gwampa forest area near the road at the 128km peg on the 18th day of September 2020 at around 11.30am,” she said. Chief Insp Makonese said efforts to identify the body failed as local villagers didn’t know him. “As police we have tried to reach out to different communities trying to identify the body but to no avail. In that regard we are requesting for any members of the public who may have a relative or friend who is missing, or who may know something about the deceased body to help or locate his relatives and family,” she said. Chief Insp Makonese said the deceased was wearing a blue and white striped T-shirt, navy blue formal pair of trousers and was bare footed. She said near the body was a black bag containing a pink jacket, small floral brown blanket, a green pair of trousers and a small plastic cup. Members of the public can contact any nearest police station or Chief Insp Makonese on 0712779089 or 0777171150.
