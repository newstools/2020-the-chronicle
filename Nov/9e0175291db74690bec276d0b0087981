CONTRACTORS working on revamping Highlanders clubhouse grounds have moved to second field after completing planting of the lawn in Ground One which is closer to Fife Street end. The lush-green lawn in the first field appears to have come up well, with the contractors, Bulawayo City Council (BCC) nursery and parks department already having started to plant the grass in second field. The project to revamp the clubhouse grounds which started in February temporarily stalled twice due to Covid-19 and when the water pump broke down. The water pump was repaired in September and work resumed. Highlanders spokesperson Ronald Moyo said they are happy with the progress made at the grounds. “It’s work in progress. We are happy with the work that has been done so far. The project is not only about one, but three pitches and our objectives haven’t changed. The goal is to have our grounds ready for use early 2021,” said Moyo. Revamping of the clubhouse is part of the club’s plans to save substantial costs in training fees. The grounds restoration project was set to take four months, but has been hampered by the Covid-19 enforced lockdown as well as the water pump which broke down. Highlanders paid the full amount of $380 000 for restoration of the clubhouse training grounds to the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) nursery and parks department, which is undertaking the work. After completion, one field will be reserved for first team use, with the junior teams using the other two fields for training sessions and home games. Once they are done with the lawn, Highlanders will erect advertising boards around the clubhouse as part of revenue generation. Highlanders will also rent out one of the grounds to social teams that use the clubhouse as their home to raise money for maintaining the facility.
