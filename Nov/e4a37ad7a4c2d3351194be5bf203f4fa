The Chronicle Yoliswa Dube-Moyo I’m sure you can relate when I say 2020 has been one hell of a roller coaster ride! We’ve been through a lot because of the Covid-19 pandemic — we really all are blessed to still be here today. One of the biggest things the year has taken away from us has been our lives as we knew them. We have a new normal now; one of which is to always wear a face mask in public. With the organisers of the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAAs) rolling out the red carpet today, that little accessory is all the more important. <img class="alignnone wp-image-520168 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Mask2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Mask2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Mask2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> I don’t know how big a gathering to expect, but one thing is for sure, a face mask is a MUST. But there’s a catch. That mask has to level up with the outfit. There’s no way you’re going to rock up in a million-dollar outfit and pair it with an orange tie-back mask from a high school Fashion and Fabrics class. Don’t get me wrong. There’s no harm in wearing such a mask on any other day. Just not today. Today is about glitz and glam. I’ve seen a lot of fancy masks out there for the ladies. From glitters and shimmer to feathers and gemstones. I’ve also seen some really cute ones that resemble masks from masquerade parties. There’s really so much to pick from and make your outfit complete. For the gentlemen, I’d imagine you’d want something more solid. Something that will match your outfit to the T, depending on what you’ll be wearing of course. There’s no way you’re going to be wearing a black tux with a blue surgical mask. No way! You need to put as much thought into your mask as you have your outfit. You’re going to be wearing the mask for most of the night (hopefully) so it’s equally important. The RoilBAAs have grown and continue to attract a broad spectrum of people. They’re not just about celebrating and recognising artistes, but business synergies are also born there so you need to look and smell good. It’s a playground for serious networking. The conditions will be different this year, but it’ll be networking all the same. Black is always a great colour to work with. It’s safe yet so rich. Black is easy to accessorise, and trust me — you may not need to buy any new accessories to work a black dress. Understand that you don’t have to always part with your hard-earned cash to look good. Look around and open your eyes to the gems you already have in your wardrobe. Make them your inspiration for the rest of your look. You’ll be surprised what magic you can work without spending a cent. Navy blue, red, white and purple are great colours for any evening do. Metallic shoes — gold or silver are also awesome for such events. <img class="alignnone wp-image-520171 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Mask3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Mask3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Mask3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> For me, a dark coloured suit would be the perfect choice for any guy who takes themselves seriously. It would really be pushing it to ask Bulawayo men to wear a black suit with a white shirt and a black bowtie — because that’s what a black tie event demands — but at least wear a well-fitted suit and be appropriate for the event.
Anyone who decides to wear a blazer and asks what shirt to wear it with — I always recommend a white one. Anything works over a white shirt, whatever the tone of your skin. You may feel white is overdone but believe me — it’ll save you a whole lot of mishap. I’ve noticed some men prefer black shirts over white ones to evening events. That works well if you know what you’re doing. A black shirt and black blazer combination will require accessories like a pocket square, lapel pin and a bow tie with a young chain to add some detail to the whole ensemble. You’ll also need to be one bold man to pull it off — black draws more attention to the pieces accompanying the suit than the suit itself. A few puffs of your favourite fragrance will certainly tie everything together perfectly. When you smell great, you’re automatically more attractive, trust me. Remember to stay safe. Covid-19 is still among us. Mask up, keep a social distance and sanitise your hands frequently.
