The Chronicle Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden took an ever-so-slight lead over President Trump in Georgia when Clayton County announced its latest results early Friday. Biden had been steadily catching up, and the county that was part of the congressional district of the late civil rights icon John Lewis put him ahead. In their latest report, Clayton officials said Biden had gained 1602 votes vs. 223 for Mr. Trump. That left Biden up by a razor-thin 917 votes statewide. – cbsnews
