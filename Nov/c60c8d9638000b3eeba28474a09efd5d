The six were among the 2 528 graduands capped by President Mnangagwa last Friday during a blended graduation ceremony. Only those graduating with first class degrees attended the physical event at the university’s Ceremonial Hall while the rest of the graduands participated virtually through social media platforms and followed proceedings on ZBCtv. Nust, like most academic institutions, conducted the blended ceremony in line with World Health Organisation guidelines and Government regulations to fight Covid-19. Of the total capped, 1 139 or 45 percent were females and 1 389 were male. — @thamamoe
