Former Highlanders striker, Tinashe Makanda who was scheduled to undergo a three-week trial in Kosovo, had his trip cancelled as a result of a recent spike in Covid-19 cases in Europe. Makanda had already secured a visa and ticket for the trip which was scheduled for November 3 but could not travel due to new travel restrictions imposed in Europe in response to the spike in Covid-19 cases. Makanda was supposed to undergo a three-week trial with Kosovo’s top league side KF Drenica . According to his representatives, TKT Sports Agency, he is likely play for a local club while they pursue other options. “The young man was supposed to fly out on Tuesday but the new travel restrictions due to spike in Covid-19 cases resulted in changes to those arrangements. They are now only allowing their returning nationals and as such the trial has been put on ice and we don’t know when things will be back to normal. It’s a big blow for us. We are now waiting for local offers,” said Trust Nyambiya of TKT Sports Agency. In correspondence seen by Chronicle Sport, KF Drenica president Agim Ademi and club chairman llir Veliqi, had undertaken to meet the player’s flight and accommodation cost. The team plays in the Kosovo Super League Division and they finished ranked at number eight in their 12 team league. Makanda severed his ties with the Bulawayo giants following the expiry of his contract in June this year and the two parties failed to reach an agreement on extending the contract. He was rumoured to have joined Bosso’s arch rivals, Dynamos but his camp vehemently denied the reports, claiming that the pictures that circulated on the social media had nothing to do with the player joining the Harare giants but was in fact a separate arrangement with Dynamos’ sponsors.
