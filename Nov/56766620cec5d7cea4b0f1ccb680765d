Police and security companies had a torrid time keeping people in check as some shoppers were jumping the queues that were at these outlets. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-519987" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Black-Friday-Pics.jpg2_.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Black-Friday-Pics.jpg2_.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Black-Friday-Pics.jpg2_-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Since the country is still grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, police were trying to enforce social distancing in the queues and encouraging those who were not wearing masks to do so. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-519989" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Black-Friday-Pics.jpg3_.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Black-Friday-Pics.jpg3_.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Black-Friday-Pics.jpg3_-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In Gweru, it was the same as stores such as Edgars and Jet were teeming with customers who thronged the stores as early as 5AM.

People were oblivious of Covid-19 pandemic as they did not observe social distancing. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-520000" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Black-Friday-Pics.jpg8_.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Black-Friday-Pics.jpg8_.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Black-Friday-Pics.jpg8_-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> At Edgars, police had to bring in dogs to force buyers to space out.
