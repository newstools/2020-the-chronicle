THE Squash Rackets Association of Zimbabwe (Sraz) will use the remainder of the year to organise friendly matches for their players to shrug off rust and prepare for next season after getting clearance to resume activities. Government, through the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) approved Sraz’s application to resume activities that were on hold due to Covid-19 restrictions. Players selected to represent Zimbabwe at international squash tournaments missed out on a numberof competitions that were put on ice due to the coronavirus pandemic which hit the entire globe. Events cancelled by World Squash Federation that were scheduled for April are the Texas Open set for Houston in America, Pakistan’s Chief of Air Staff International, Oceania Junior Championships in Australia, Irish Open and Egypt’s El Gouna Open. The regional tournaments in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Zambia were also postponed to next year. Lucky Mlilo, Sraz president welcomed the Government’s clearance. “Unfortunately, we are at a time when all the major tournaments would have been played. This development only gives us the opportunity to resume training and keep fit for next year. Our players cannot even participate in any remaining regional tournaments as they have been inactive since March. “With no events in November and December, it’s too late to organise the league so it will be just friendly matches,” Mlilo said. During the course of the year, Sraz intended to refurbish squash courts at former Group A schools, a move that Mlilo says has been delayed by lack of resources. The seasoned administrator said his association is still appealing for corporate backing for the courts refurbishments project.
