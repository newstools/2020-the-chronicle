FIVE men facing 35 counts of armed robbery and one count of murder all allegedly committed in Beitbridge, are set to stand trial on 10 November at the Beitbridge regional court. The gang was allegedly working with the notorious John Sithole alias Kedha who was killed in a shootout with the police last month at a house in Dulivhadzimu suburb. Kedha held 10 people hostage at his rented house during a stand-off with the police crack team that lasted 14 hours. Among the captives were fellow tenants, his wife and her 10-year-old sister. The hostages were rescued by the Police Special Tactics Team (PSTT). Blessing Itai Chiri (38), Dereck Ndou (34), Brian Mukosi (30), Mapfumo Makhado (31) and Taurai Coaster Dube (42) all of Dulivhadzimu in Beitbridge were arrested in the border town on 20 October. They were not asked to plead to the charges when they appeared before Beitbridge regional magistrate, Mr Stanford Mambanje who remanded them in custody to 10 November. The State led by Mr Manyonga Kuvarega alleges that the accused persons, along with three others who are still at large, committed 35 armed robberies and one murder case in Beitbridge district.
