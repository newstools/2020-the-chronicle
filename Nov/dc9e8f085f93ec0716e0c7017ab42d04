After a two-year hiatus, the king of house music, Oskido is back and with a bang! After releasing his studio album ‘Akhiwe’ last month which broke the Internet, he is preparing to release more music through an EP titled ‘Keep the faith today’. For Akhiwe, an album which was released after a lengthy hiatus from releasing his own projects, the 52-year-old produced a scorcher that was packed with 13 high-octane tracks. He featured some, if not most of the best artists in the SA music industry including Xelimpilo, Toshi, Monique Bingham, Kabza de Small, Professor, Winnie Khumalo, Mpumi and MFR Souls among many others. It remains to be seen who he featured on the forthcoming EP, if there are any features. In line with the theme of his EP, Oskido has been sharing motivational quotes with fans on his Facebook page. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic which has shaken the music industry, Oskido seems to be having a good year. Other than the successful release of his album, recently, his Kalawa Jazmee stable signed a deal with Idols SA which will see the winner of the current season 16 of the music competition being signed to Oskido’s independent record label.
