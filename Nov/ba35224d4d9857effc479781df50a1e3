VICTORIA Falls Municipality has elevated former mayor Nkosilathi Jiyane to Alderman status after serving the local authority for more than 10 consecutive years. Residents welcomed the development as they commended council for honouring people who have served the local authority well. The municipality which awaits official pronouncement of city status by President Mnangagwa honoured Alderman Jiyane last Friday making him the fourth alderman in Victoria Falls after Roy Dube, Josephat Sipulila Mpofu and Enoch Sibanda who were honoured in 2006 after serving 10 years as councillors. The council is also planning to honour President Mnangagwa with Freedom of City, a highest honour bestowed by a municipality to a valuable member of the community or to a visiting dignitary. The municipality is grateful to the President for his contribution to the town’s growth into a city. Alderman or Alderwoman is an honour bestowed on elected people who would have served for 10 consecutive years as a councillors or eight years as a mayor and gives one privileges in the local authority as an advisor. Alderman Jiyane was elected councillor on a Zanu-PF ticket in 2001 through a by-election. He retained the seat and became Mayor in 2008 until 2013. He said he was elated by the gesture. “This recognition means a lot to me as it shows that the council recognises how we worked hard for the community,” he said. It was during his time as mayor that Victoria Falls hosted the Comesa Summit in 2009 and the United Nations World Tourism Organisation General Assembly in 2013 where he was chairperson of the local steering committee for both. The UNWTO was hosted after he had left office following elections in 2013 but was seconded to continue as chairperson because of his leadership qualities. — @ncubeleon
