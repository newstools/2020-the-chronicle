HAVING heard his coach describe the Tanzanian League as not so competitive, former Highlanders striker Prince Dube yesterday rose from the bench to give coach Loga his first point as national team coach as the Warriors came from behind to draw two apiece against African champions Algeria in a Caf Afcon qualifier at the National Sports Stadium. Ahead of the first leg away to Algeria last Thursday, the Warriors coach was quoted in the media saying while it was good that Dube, now with ambitious Tanzanian side Azam, was scoring, it was important to note that he was playing in the Tanzanian league while the game against Algeria will see him face off against top defenders in Europe. “Yes, Prince is scoring but this is Tanzanian league we are talking about, he is not going to face small boys, he is going to play top defenders playing in Europe. Its good Prince is scoring, its fantastic, can he jump three levels up?” Loga said. But yesterday, Dube came off the substitutes’ bench with less than 10 minutes to go and the Warriors down 1-2 and with his first touch from the deadly right foot, the nation’s dream of a third straight Afcon finals qualification was resurrected. It was Dube’s eighth goal in 12 appearances for the national team. There is no doubt that the boy is enjoying his game, both at club level and whenever he dons that national team jersey and it came as a huge surprise when Loga chose to undermine the Tanzanian League but chose to field someone who is inactive. Now Dube has scored and probably rescued him (Loga) from a backlash from fans because we were heading for a clear defeat which would have all but blown our chances of qualifying for Cameroon. The Warriors now need to avoid defeats in their last two games against Botswana, away and a home tie against Zambia then the ticket to Yaounde will be secured and it might just be because of Dube, nicknamed Mgadafi by the Highlanders fans.
