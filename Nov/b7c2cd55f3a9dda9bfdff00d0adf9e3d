The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Following the introduction of new pageant, Zimbabwe Miss Tourism World, there has been confusion among pageant lovers who had become accustomed to Miss Tourism Zimbabwe. Last month, pageant lovers were introduced to Zimbabwe Miss Tourism World but many thought it was just a vice versa of words for the same old Miss Tourism Zimbabwe pageant. The organisers of the Zimbabwe Miss Tourism World have explained that the two pageants are different. “The difference between Zimbabwe Miss Tourism World and Miss Tourism Zimbabwe is that Sarah Mpofu (Miss Tourism Zimbabwe licence holder) runs the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA)’s Miss Tourism Zimbabwe and their winner contests at Miss Tourism International. “We have the Zimbabwean licence for Miss Tourism World, an event that’s organised by Golden International Cooperation of China,” said the new pageant’s organiser, Tapfumaneyi Banhire who is the general manager of 24/7. Turning to preparations for their pageant, Banhire said they successfully held auditions for Zimbabwe Miss Tourism World this past weekend ahead of the pageant slated for November 24 in Harare. From the Southern region, five contestants were selected from a total of 12 participants countrywide and these are Nozipho Ndlovu, Celine Sialumba, Patience Nomazulu Gumbo, Onesimo (Miss Nust) and Irene Tuturu. “The auditions had models from Matabeleland North, South and Bulawayo provinces. The finalists will in Harare on November 21 and then proceed to Chinhoyi University of Technology Hotel where their boot camp will be until 24 November. “The pageant’s finals will be held at The Venue in Avondale, Harare on 24 November starting at 6pm,” Banhire said.
