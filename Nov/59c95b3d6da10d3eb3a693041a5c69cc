A VICTORIA Falls man who could not accept that his wife who is a nurse had left him, has been arrested after he armed himself with a shovel and smashed the woman’s car windows at her workplace. Brainwell Mafuba (35) of 4820 Chinotimba and employed at Chinotimba Medical Centre, has been in separation with Ms Tsitsi Chimombe (38) who stays at the Victoria Falls Hospital cottages where she works. Mafuba pleaded guilty to a charge of malicious damage to property. The magistrate Ms Linda Dzvene remanded Mafuba out of custody on his own cognisance to tomorrow for sentence. Mafuba told the court that he acted out of anger after his ex-wife insulted his mother who had asked to see the couple’s child. He said the car in question was his as he is the one who bought it when the couple was still together. Prosecuting Ms Mitchelle Jakasi said Mafuba drove to Victoria Falls Hospital where he used a shovel to smash the front, back and side window screens of the vehicle. “On the 28th day of October 2020 at around 8AM the complainant parked her car, a Toyota Runx, at the hospital car park and got inside the hospital where she is employed. At around 11:40am, the accused went to the hospital armed with a shovel and smashed the front, rear and side window screens of the complainant’s vehicle,” said Ms Jakasi. The value of the damaged property is US$230. — @ncubeleon
