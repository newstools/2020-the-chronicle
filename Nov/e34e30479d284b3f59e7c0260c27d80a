First l was a rapper, nurtured and raised by Mendoz_ Da_Mystic (Mos’Hy). “As a member of C-Four Music Group, l always considered myself as the least in the group in terms of lyrical content, thus, l then began to develop and tutor myself as a music producer in 2012 after believing in my heart and driven by the passion that had a good ear for good quality music,” said SheKnows Koko. Drawing inspiration from producers like Hitboy, Noah Shabib, TMinus, Timberland, Kanye West and Doctor Dre, SheKnows Koko said he is grateful to the C-Four team who have always had his back. “In 2016, l founded the Excellence Music Records Label, one of the record labels that has gained popularity in the City of Kings.

Commenting on his latest work, a third studio album titled Dark Thoughts 2.0, SheKnows Koko said, “Dark Thoughts 2.0 is a soliloquy by SheKnows KoKo being released as his third studio album on the 3rd of November 2020.
