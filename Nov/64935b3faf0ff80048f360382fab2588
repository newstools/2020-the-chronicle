THE trial of former ZIMCHE chief operations officer, Florence Chimbumu, charged for forging academic certificates that earned her the top job, will be handled by another magistrate when it starts next month. This was after the magistrate Ms Tendai Muchini, who was handling the matter, indicated that she will be going on vacation. The trial was supposed to open on Saturday, but the court said it was prudent that a new magistrate took over the matter in her absence. Chimbumu, who is being represented by Mr Nathaniel Chigoro, is expected to return to court on December 17 and 18 for trial on fraud charges. Prosecutor Mrs Stylone Marufu was ready to commence with the trial on Saturday having lined up three witnesses to testify in the matter. It is alleged that sometime in January this year, ZIMCHE’s director audit and risk management, one Mr Mangwende, carried a human resource audit. The audit, according to the State, covered issues to do with appointments, recruitment, promotion, leave of management and certificates verification. On June 2, Mr Mangwende emailed heads of department and the company’s chief executive to submit their qualifications for audit. It was during that time that he noted that Chimbumu’s two Ordinary Level certificates had the same candidate and centre numbers, among other irregularities. Mr Mangwende reportedly wrote letters to Zimsec and Hexco seeking verification and validation of the said two certificates. The court heard that Zimsec noted that Chimbumu had no seven subjects at Ordinary Level as was being indicated by her certificates. The matter was taken to the police leading to her arrest and subsequent appearance in court charged with fraud or alternatively forging. Professor Peter Dzvimbo is representing ZIMCHE in the matter.
