In no way must SADC be allowed to cease as both a wise saying and catalyser for political, economic and social development on the African continent. Tragically ironic, however, the fear of that development becoming a reality looms large in our region, like a second wave of Covid-19, while the rest of the Southern African regional grouping mulls over what remedial actions to take against Islamist bandits now wreaking havoc in Mozambique to stop them in their tracks and in that way save other countries from also becoming victims of the Jihadists who have occupied and cut off the northern part of Mozambique from the rest of the country ruled by FRELIMO which brought independence to that former Portuguese colony. Last July the Islamists warned South Africa as SADC’s Big Brother both militarily and economically not to intervene in their rampages across a country key to Zimbabwe and Malawi as a gateway to the sea, the Indian ocean, for both our imports and exports. Our country has already expressed dismay and concern over developments in our neighbour to the east where the late liberation icon, President Samora Machel, played a pivotal role in the armed struggle for the liberation of our motherland. It should appear to all and sundry concerned at the development in what was formerly Portuguese East Africa that mobilisation of a rapid-results military task force by SADC stands as the only possible solution right now to rout the Islamist rebels and stop them in their tracks before what they may consider as success in their programme to persuade them to attack Zimbabwe or other neighbouring states in order to extend their Jihadist influence. Time is certainly not on the SADC side and any further dilly dallying by the regional development community in checking the rebels’ advance across Mozambique’s borders might result in destruction of lives, not to mention disruption of economic developments elsewhere in our region. Islamist fundamentalism which is the driving force behind the Jihadists makes that faith a cousin of imperialism both of which are pythons driven by demonic spirits so alluring to some, who are ignorant of the real driving motives behind imperialists and Jihadists, capturing and reducing their victims or adherence to virtual puppets. When both Jihadism and imperialism are done with their victim, the connoisseurs are rendered cast-out skins of the pythons that are wont perpetually to flap in the wind. But while imperialism enslaves and disempowers victims at home, Islamic fundamentalism causes flight into exile by thousands of those who resist it, thereby disrupting lives and with that economic and social development at home, witness Mozambicans fleeing their homes to seek exile in Malawi because of their abhorrence of tyrannic rule by the Jihadists who invaded their country. Now, even though the imperialists and the Jihadists are ideologically strange bedfellows, they may in the case of Zimbabwe lure each other into political adultery to effect regime change – an agenda that remains unfulfilled in the West to this day – in a desperate bid to breed Zimbabwean mindsets that are subservient to that foreign couple. Now considering the racial oppression that blacks in this country suffered in colonial Rhodesia, unmitigated patriots today might wish to decree and declare that only people whose hearts are vessels of fear of the Lord for wisdom to be their portion get anywhere near the citadels of power in our country. Similarly, only those Zimbabweans whose hearts pulsate with love for the motherland must find their way to power by the grace of God, but that those whose hearts are swollen with greed and criminal intent to corruptly feast on our national resources for their personal aggrandisement, at the behest of THAT, THAT, THAT thief, killer and destroyer must perpetually be kept in the woods with no whiff of the scent of power filtering into their noses on account of their dastardly lifestyles.
