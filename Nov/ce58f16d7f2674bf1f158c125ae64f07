Sharing with his fans and friends on Facebook, Chipman narrated the traumatic encounter with the thugs saying he was lucky to be alive. “Robbed on Saturday 21st of November. Machete gangsters broke into our house n took some of gadgets (cellphones, laptop), money, trousers n shoes. My colleague n I did not manage to fight them because they had weapons (machetes n catapults). I just wanna give thanks to God that we are all safe. Life is very worth comparing to all the items they took. We hustle n buy new things but will never buy life,” said Chipman. His friends consoled him.
