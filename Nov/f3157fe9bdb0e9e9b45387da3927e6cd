Have you been hearing songs by the late musician, Cal Vin a lot lately and are you now beginning to enjoy his music? Well, the good news is that it is not late to become a fan of his. He may be gone but being a talented lyricist, he made timeless music that is still available on online music platforms like YouTube and iTunes where people can listen to and download it. Following Cal Vin’s death two weeks ago, a lot of local radio stations have been playing his music almost hourly in appreciation of the artiste. Instead of just playing his hits Bebengakholwa, Banjalo Abantu and Zikhupan, the stations have been playing his less-known tracks like Thabani, Owen, Mama, Eng’phuma khona, Roses, King Kong and Grind China among many others. These are just some of the songs that have earned Cal Vin new fans as his following on social media is increasing. Some have since downloaded his music and are blazing it in their vehicles. “I didn’t know this guy was this talented. I’m a big fan of his now,” commented one Thulani Ndlovu who was heard playing Cal Vin’s songs in his vehicle just after the artiste’s burial on Sunday. Other than his music, T-shirts that were printed with Cal Vin’s face have also proved to be a hit. A limited number was availed just before the burial and those without felt left out on Sunday as almost half of the guests at the Amphitheatre were donning them. Noticing that there was high demand for the T-shirts, gospel rapper T1Nda who made them, said he was considering working on another batch. “The T-shirts were being sold at US$5 and sold out in no time. Due to the high demand, I’m now considering making another batch, but they’ll be sold for US$10 as this money is going to Cal Vin’s mum,” said T1Nda.
