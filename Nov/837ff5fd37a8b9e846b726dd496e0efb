AFTER realising the huge gap that existed due to shortage of schools in Gwanda, Garikai/Hlalani Kuhle area residents decided to spearhead the construction of Phakama Primary School in their ward. Sometime last year, the Ward 8 residents contributed US$1 each towards buying building material which was used to construct a slab for a classroom block. Gwanda Municipality later came in and used devolution funds to construct a classroom block and purchased furniture. The funds were also used to build the foundation of another classroom block. While the residents boast about being the pioneers of such a significant project within the community, they eagerly await completion of the school which will ease challenges faced by parents in securing learning places for their children. A resident, Ms Olivia Moyo said she had to send her child to live with a relative in Bulawayo during school terms after she failed to secure a place for her at Gwanda schools. “I relocated to Gwanda from Bulawayo last year during the second term and I’m staying at the Garikai/Hlalani Kuhle houses. I tried to secure a place for my daughter who was in Grade Three at the time. I failed to get a place for her in all the local schools as they were full and I ended up sending her back to Bulawayo where she is staying with my sister and she is still learning at her old school. She comes to me during the school holidays and during the course of the school term she will be in Bulawayo,” she said. “I’m really looking forward to completion of this new school because I plan to transfer my child from Bulawayo once the school opens. It really pains me that I have to stay apart from my child just because I failed to secure a learning space for her locally.” Another resident, Mrs Jane Maphosa, said it was a hassle to secure a place for a child especially for Grade One learners. She said while there were Early Childhood Development centres where children could do part of their infant education, it becomes difficult when parents wanted to enrol their children for Grade One. <img class="wp-image-517054 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Mrs-Jane-Maphosa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Mrs-Jane-Maphosa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Mrs-Jane-Maphosa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Jane Maphosa Ms Deborah Ntini, also of Gwanda, said there was a need for more schools to be built within the town to match the population which continues to increase. She said while her grandchildren were not yet in school, she does not wish to face serious challenges trying to secure learning place for them when the time comes. “The town’s population continues to grow as more and more people are building new houses but the number of schools has remained the same. The number of schools both primary and secondary can no longer cater for the increasing population which calls for the need for more schools. I’m looking forward to the completion of this school as it will help me in the future when it’s time to send my children to school,” she said. <img class="wp-image-517057 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Ms-Deborah-Ntini.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Ms-Deborah-Ntini.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Ms-Deborah-Ntini-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Deborah Ntini Ward 8 councillor, Ntuthuko Ndebele said a ground-breaking ceremony for the school project was held three years back but the construction process delayed as the municipality did not have funds. He said last year residents from his ward decided to make contributions towards building the school as they realised its significance. “The process of building the school delayed as council didn’t have funds. Residents then decided to make contributions. Although some were not forthcoming, those who were willing contributed US$1 each and we used the money to buy building material. We also got assistance from some members of the business community from the town. Residents provided labour to dig trenches for the foundation and council provided us with a builder,” he said. “Later council availed devolution funds which were used to complete the classroom block and to purchase furniture. Now the school has one complete classroom block which has two classes that are fully furnished. A second classroom block is under construction and it’s at slab level. The challenge is that the project has been on hold for a long time now because of financial challenges and there is need for it to resume so that the school can be completed and people can benefit.” Clr Ndebele said children mostly from his ward were severely affected as they did not have a school. He said some parents failed to secure places for their children in local schools and some were forced to rely on schools in the rural areas or other towns. Clr Ndebele said most parents rely on public schools which have limited space as they could not afford fees charged by private schools. He said there was also a need for more secondary schools. Gwanda mayor, Clr Njabulo Siziba said council proposed construction of Phakama Primary School after realising the need which had arisen as a result of shortage of schools. He said it was the desire of the municipality to build more schools in order to cater for the number of the children which kept increasing as the town grows. He said funding remained a stumbling block and appealed to various stakeholders who could partner council in this cause. “We used money that we had been allocated under the devolution fund to build a classroom block and buy furniture but the money isn’t enough to complete the project. As part of efforts to source funding I have written to the town clerk requesting that the municipality engages mining companies in our area so that they may fund this project as well as other development projects,” he said. “It’s really a cause for concern that children are failing to secure learning places as this means they are being deprived of their basic right to education. As a municipality we wish to build as many schools as possible in each ward.” Clr Ndebele said Phakama Primary School was set to open for Grade One learners next year. He said learners had already registered to secure learning places. He said the school would continue to enrol more grades as more classroom blocks were going to be built. Gwanda Town has five primary and two secondary schools. — @DubeMatutu
