It is really sad that rapper, Cal Vin filled up the 5 000-seater Bulawayo Amphitheatre under sad circumstances as his funeral service was held there yesterday. This is something he had always hoped to do and naturally should have done when he was alive as his art and talent that was unmatched, deserved such support. But alas, he spent most of his lifetime begging for people to support his career with only a few heeding that call. It was disheartening to watch people get into the venue in their numbers for his funeral service and patiently wait for his body to arrive. This should have been the case when he held his “Made in Bulawayo” concerts. <img class="alignnone wp-image-517039 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/cal-vin-funeral.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/cal-vin-funeral.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/cal-vin-funeral-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> And these people who filled the Amphitheatre were not your everyday music lovers as they included high-ranking officials among them Bulawayo mayor Solomon Mguni, Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube, National Arts Council of Zimbabwe director Nicholas Moyo and Highlanders Football Club chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube. On the artistes’ end, almost all of the notables from Bulawayo were in attendance — from Babongile Sikhonjwa, Sandra Ndebele, Novuyo Seagirl, Qeqe Mntambo, Lee McHoney, DJs Skaiva, Nospa, Slimzar, to Ngoma Ingoma band. They were joined by counterparts from Harare — Trevor Dongo, Mudiwa and music promoters — Aldrin “Beefy” Harrison, Walter Wanyanya and music producer Kuda Musasiwa. Now, imagine if Cal Vin had held an album launch at that venue and filled it up. This certainly would have gone a long way in his career, something Mguni highlighted saying the city’s artistes need to be supported when they are alive. However, it was nice seeing the artistes united as they all agreed that Cal Vin was a unifier. <img class="alignnone wp-image-517037 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Cal-Vin-casket.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Cal-Vin-casket.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Cal-Vin-casket-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Bulawayo, you need to support your artistes,” Dongo told guests at the funeral service. Artistes from Cal Vin’s Kontrol Tribe stable definitely got him smiling from his coffin as they put on a farewell show that got the crowd on its feet. Standout characters were the young Tebza and Mawiza who certainly proved that they will keep Cal Vin’s legacy alive as they took charge of the stage in a way that left those gathered convinced. “We promise to keep your legacy alive,” Tebza said. Cal Vin’s rival, Asaph was a sorry sight. It was clear he was pained as he was spotted crying from time to time. He was not in the mood of talking as he seemed to prefer keeping to himself. Sikhonjwa who was one of Cal Vin’s top supporters also shed tears and was visibly in disbelief. <img class="wp-image-516807 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Calvin-performs.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Calvin-performs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Calvin-performs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Cal Vin It was clear media personality and actress Mbo Mahocs who lost her young brother Tammy recently was yet to heal as she was not her usual self. Having had a close relationship with Cal Vin as she was one of the key vixens on his Zikhupan music video, it was evident Mbo was shattered. “My guy, let’s do everything that we want now. Tomorrow is never guaranteed. Cal Vin gave us his all. He gave us so much music and I’m convinced he lived the way he wanted,” Mbo Mahocs said in a sombre tone. As a parting shot, the late Oliver Mtukudzi’s manager, Wanyanya said: “Today, we said our final goodbye to that Luveve Boy, a young king who knew no grey areas, he was either black or white. He either was for it or against and there was no confusion in where he stood. I hope you are proud of how we celebrated you sir. May you rest easy, you ran your race well.”
