THE pride of theatre productions in Bulawayo, Bambelela Arts is set to star in three plays which are a collaboration between Bulawayo-based Geraldine Roche and Harare’s Jasen Mphepo Little Theatre. The one-hour theatrical plays will be premièred in Harare at Jasen Mphepo Little Theatre. These are The Naked Truth which will première on November 24, Wish List on November 26 and My Son’s Dreams on November 27. The appearance by Bambelela Arts comes after they were crowned the 2020 Geraldine Roche drama champions at competitions that pitted groups from Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South. Geraldine Roche project co-ordinator, Khaliphile Sibanda said the events are meant to boost income for the successful outfit. “These are charged shows which will result in the group making a living out of their craft. It’s always cool to show our craft to people from outside our city hence we’re looking forward to the events. “We need to showcase the best of Bulawayo so that people visit our city to enjoy arts.” Theatre Co-ordinator for Jasen Mphepo Little Theatre, Caroline Magenga said they are looking forward to hosting Bambelela Arts as they want to expose the ensemble to the rest of the country. “We’ve had fruitful productions with Bambelela Arts in the past. They’re a group of talented, passionate individuals who have been a resounding success. We thought it would be good for them to come to Harare so that we audiences enjoy different productions while exposing Bambelela Arts to new audiences at the same time. “We know they’ll live up to expectations,” said Magenga. — @mthabisi_mthire.
