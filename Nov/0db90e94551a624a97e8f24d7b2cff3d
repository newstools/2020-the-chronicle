GWANDA-based musician, Master Zhoe is expected to finally launch his fifth album today. Titled Gwenyambira, the much-anticipated album features Nicholas “Madzibaba” Zacharia and Zimdancehall musician Bazooka. It will be launched at newly opened leisure centre, Endaweni Pub and Grill in Gwanda with revellers being entertained as from midday by Madzibaba, Cutie G, Khoi Khoi, Zagoe, Skollah, Zhezhingtons, Kadder and Master Zhoe himself. On the album, the musician went all out in order to appease his fans after having gotten ample time to work on it during the lockdown. The album was produced at X-Studios by fast-rising producer DJ Drumz. Two of the tracks, Ndiwe and Sanyeperwe which feature Bazooka were released earlier this year with Mazuva which features Madzibaba expected out today with the rest of the album. Other tracks are Gwenyambira, Rova Ngoma, Simudza, Vegodo, Ngimthandile, Kunozorora, Jehova, Ngirozi, Ticheze and Kuzofara. The album also has two bonus tracks — It’s feeling good and I’m your hero. Speaking ahead of the launch, Master Zhoe’s assistant manager, Morateoa Sidange, said all is in place for the launch.
“Everything is in place for the album launch which will see Master Zhoe perform all the tracks and also some from his previous works. “As X-Studios, we’ll ensure that people get value for money as this will be our first live event since the lockdown,” said Sidange. She added that artistes from the X-Studios stable will also perform some of their songs during the show. — @mthabisi_mthire
