The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent A group of artistes in Bulawayo is hard at work rehearsing for a piece that they will perform at the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards ceremony tomorrow. Earlier in the week, the artistes were seen at the Sabela Studios, sweating it out, as they were trying to get their lines right and performances on point. Under the watchful eyes of Saimon Mambazo, Thembelani Theodore Mdlaziba and Gomez, the artistes who included Asaph, Madlela Skhobokhobo, Fish McSwagg, Msizkay and Vocal Ex were getting instructions on what to do from the three. <img class="size-full wp-image-485360" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Asaph13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Asaph13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Asaph13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Asaph Director of the whole production, Mambazo said he was happy with the progress made thus far. “We’re happy with the progress that we’ve made on the piece.
