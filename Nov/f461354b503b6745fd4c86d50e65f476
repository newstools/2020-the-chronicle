THE Matabeleland North Volleyball Association has appointed a new executive whose immediate task is to continue working on improving the game’s standards in the province. The elective congress was held at Mhlahlandlela Government complex in Bulawayo at the weekend. Chairman Sifiso Buhlungu retained his post unopposed with Isaac Nkosilathi and Lincorn Moyo coming in as his deputies. Mthokozisi Moyo is the secretary while Elerne Maphosa will be the treasurer. Mazula Ntandoyenkosi, Aaron Phiri and Given Matsika are committee members Speaking at the congress, Buhlungu called on the new executive to work together in improving volleyball in the province. “The major challenges that the association has include lack of sponsorship, coming up with a running league and hosting tournaments. Allow me to state that these challenges are not hindrances or barriers that cannot be solved. Let’s work together, lets join hands and overcome these challenges,” he said. Matabeleland North has not had meaningful volleyball action over the years but work is being done on upgrading the sport. Before Covid-19 wreaked havoc and iced all sporting activities in the country, the association was working towards the creation of a league meant to feature teams from all the districts in the province. At the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) annual general meeting held in Matabeleland North early this year, it was resolved that all provinces should adopt beach and sitting volleyball.
Buhlungu said they were working tirelessly to ensure that Matabeleland North becomes a force to reckon with in volleyball circles. — @innocentskizoe
