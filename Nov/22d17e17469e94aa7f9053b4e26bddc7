Other notable names which made the list include Cde Tafanana Zhou who is eyeing Mberengwa District chairperson post and Cde Kandros Mugabe who is eyeing Kwekwe District secretary for finance post. Another highlight of the meeting was the disqualification of Cde Tawanda Karikoga who was vying for the Gokwe South district chairmanship on the basis that he has spent a month outside the country. Some members from his district said he could not run it from South Africa. Zanu PF Midlands Provincial spokesperson Cde Cornelius Mupereri said the chosen were members who were able to lead the party and assist in members mobilisation. “ It’s all systems go for the Midlands Zanu-PF DCC elections following the announcement of members who made it to the final list after vetting at provincial and national level in a process that saw 26 members being dropped from contesting the polls,” he said. Zanu PF Politburo member, Cde Simbarashe Mumbengegwi said the party is bigger than individuals adding that there should be no imposition of leaders.
