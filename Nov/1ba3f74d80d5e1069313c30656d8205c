BMetro correspondent Hazel Marimbiza got the UNFPA Gender Based Violence (GBV) Journalist of the Year Award for a series of stories on the effects of abuse. Marimbiza was commended for digging deeper into the abuse of men who often suffer in silence even though they are also victims of sexual abuse. Chronicle reporter, Nqobile Tshili was runner up in the GBV category. Tshili was awarded for presenting a story of a 22-year-old woman who created WhatsApp chat groups with more than 700 followers, which discussed how to handle relationship issues in the wake of escalating cases of GBV during the lockdown.

I dedicate this award to all the women who have risked their lives while trying to give life to unborn babies and women out there who continue being pillars of strength despite challenges,” said Moyo-Ndlovu.
