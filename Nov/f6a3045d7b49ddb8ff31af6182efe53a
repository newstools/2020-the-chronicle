Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said on Monday that his department had uncovered evidence that the Bushiris entered the country using visitors’ visas, and opted to conduct business, which is not allowed. Two previous notices sent to the Bushiris explaining details in their permanent residence applications were also withdrawn. The latest one was sent out in August, just two months before they were arrested. The couple have been in the country since 6 September 2009. The formal bail application began on Monday in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court, with Magistrate Thandi Thelede hearing the State’s arguments as to why the five accused should not be granted bail. The State deems all five suspects to be flight risks, especially the Bushiris, as they possess multiple passports and are not South African citizens. Advocate Annelene van der Heever, who is representing Bushiri, his wife and Ntlokwana, argued that her clients were not flight risks, saying that if they wanted to flee they would have done so when they were first arrested in February last year. However, the State said on Monday that Ntlokwana had not yet handed in her current or expired passports. – citizen
