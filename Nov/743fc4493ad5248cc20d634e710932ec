FARMERS who joined the Intwasa/ Pfumvudza Programme in Mangwe District have started planting following the rains that were received last week. Mangwe District is generally dry but farmers say with the new Intwasa method there was hope of bumper harvests.
A team from the Food and Nutrition Council (FNC) on Tuesday visited the district to assess preparations for planting. The council also presented findings on the ZimVac report to the district officials. A farmer, Mr Blessed Sithole, from Empandeni West said he was enthusiastic about the programme. “I was the first to do my preparation. I’m waiting for the seed to germinate then I start mulching. I once did this while I was doing urban farming in Bulawayo and got better yields. So, with the support we received from the Government, I am hopeful we will get bumper harvests,” he said. Mr Sithole said although some say Intwasa is labour-intensive, he believes that all hard work in digging holes is justified during cultivation as there is less work because all the cultivation is just around the ridges of the holes instead of covering every bit of the field. “This programme saves a lot of seed. I used just 10 kgs on my four plots, instead of the 15-20 kgs that I used to buy in the past years. I’m expecting to get a tonne per plot which will be one tonne for traditional grain, one tonne of soya and sunflower and two tonnes of maize which is enough to feed my family with surplus for sale,” said Mr Sithole. He said he reserved a part of his field for traditional farming so that he compares the results with the Intwasa programme. Mr Sithole said Agritex officers are on the ground monitoring progress and ensuring every farmer follows proper procedures.- @themkhust
