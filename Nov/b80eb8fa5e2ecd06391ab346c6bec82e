The Chronicle Kaizer Chiefs are set to be without a total of six players next month while coach Gavin Hunt looks to further fine-tune his squad. With the new season now in full swing and Hunt having to make do with his current squad after Chiefs saw their two-window Fifa transfer ban appeal dismissed earlier this week, the upcoming Fifa week poses another challenge at The Village. Amakhosi will be without six players who have all been called up for international duty, making things just a little bit tougher for the four-time league-winning coach, who will be hoping to use the time to do some groundwork on his charges for the next few months. The likes of Itumeleng Khune, Reeve Frosler and Lebogang Manyama have all been called up for Bafana Bafana, who face Sao Tome and Principe in back-to-back home and away Afcon 2021 qualifiers. Meanwhile, Daniel Akpeyi, Anthony Akumu and Khama Billiat will also be away with Nigeria, Kenya and Zimbabwe respectively, leaving the club slightly short on key figures in both defence and attack. Hunt will thus have to work on getting some of the fringe players up to the required standard in the event that injuries strike any of his star players during the course of the season. Chiefs cannot sign any players before March 2, when they will then be allowed to register any free agents available in the market or promote from their youth structures again. â€“ Kickoff
