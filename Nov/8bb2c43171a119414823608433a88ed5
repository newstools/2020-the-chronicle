RAINS which were accompanied by heavy winds destroyed five schools and several homesteads in five villages in Gwanda District. Preliminary investigations have shown that five schools have been affected while the number of affected homsteads is yet to be established. The councillor of Ward 1, Stanford Nkala said a number of families were left stranded after their food, household property and homes were destroyed by the rains. He said two children were reportedly injured in the process and were admitted to Gwanda Provincial Hospital. “Rains that were received on Tuesday evening have caused severe damage in five villages in our ward. The affected villages are Masholomoshe, Nkazhe, Matshiya, Matshetsheni and Magedleni Villages. Five schools were affected as roofs of some of the classroom blocks were blown off namely Masholomoshe Primary, Nkazhe Primary and Secondary as well as Matshiya and Matshetsheni Primary Schools. <img class="wp-image-518171 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/primary-school-ruined-by-rain.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/primary-school-ruined-by-rain.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/primary-school-ruined-by-rain-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nkazhe primary school in Gwanda district “Several homesteads were damaged as roofs were blown off or walls collapsed. Some families have been left in the open as all their huts were damaged and they are in desperate need of accommodation. Some families don’t have food as their supplies were soiled by the rain and they are in desperate need of intervention. ‘I’m still in the process of getting figures on the total number of affected households and extent of damage but so far I have established that 32 homesteads were affected in Nkazhe Village. I’m still to get statistics from other villages,” he said. Cllr Nkala said the rains hit the area on Tuesday at around 5PM and were accompanied by strong winds. He said villagers had long waited for the rains to come hoping that they would manage to cultivate their fields and get water for domestic use and for their livestock but they were left in despair. Acting Gwanda District Development Coordinator (DDC), Mr Thulani Moyo said a team had been deployed to assess the extent of the damages. “Five villages in Ward 1 were affected by rains which hit the area on Tuesday. A team has been deployed to assess the extent of the damaged and we are yet to compile a detailed report on the number of households and schools that have been affected so that we also have an appreciation of the kind of intervention needed,” she said.-@DubeMatutu
