It is my wish to see them have everything a wrestler needs for training and I’m going to ensure that they get the proper attire for the sport,” said Suzuki. Zimbabwe Wrestling Federation president, Tapiwa Masinire thanked the Japanese community for their cooperation and hopes to see a fruitful relationship between Zimbabwe and Japan in the revival and development of wrestling in the country. “We really benefited a lot in this program especially on different wrestling drills that were showcased by Suzuki and I hope our relationship with japan regarding the sport of wrestling will go a long way,” he said.
