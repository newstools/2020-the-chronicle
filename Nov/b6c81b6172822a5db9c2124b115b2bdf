Moments before he left his mansion in Domboshava for Dreams Nightclub on Saturday evening, as usual, flamboyant businessman Genius “Ginimbi” Kadungure posted a video clip on his Instagram page advising friends and fans that he was off to celebrate socialite, Michelle “Moanna” Amuli’s 27th birthday. “My name is Ginimbi. It’s time to go out. We are going to Dreams in the next few minutes. It’s going to go down and we’re going to pop some champagne. It’s going to be champagne showers tonight. “See you there. Driving my Rolls Royce,” he posted before playing music in his popular purple Rolls Royce Phantom just to hype up his fans.  Clad in white jeans, a white designer D Squared shirt and spiked red bottom shoes, Ginimbi who seemed to be in very high spirits posted the video not knowing it was going to be his last. “Dressing is a way of life,” he simply captioned a photo which he shared at the same time as the video. This is how Ginimbi lived his life. He enjoyed dressing up and turning up at events and while at it, keeping his multitudes of followers well updated. His posts always kept followers entertained with some joining him in the quest for fun. According to Ginimbi’s sister Nelia, Ginimbi had invited two of his friends, Malawian Limumba Karim and Mozambican Elisha for Moana’s birthday celebration. She said following their mother’s death earlier this year as well as their brother Andrew last year, only four of them were left. The funeral wake, Nelia said will be at Ginimbi’s mansion in Domboshava.
