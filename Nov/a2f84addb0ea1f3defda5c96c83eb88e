SOUTH Africa-based rapper Mlungisi “Mlue Jay” Moyo who has been nominated for the Zim Hip Hop Awards for the third time, says he is humbled by the nomination and hopes to win this time around. Mlue Jay is nominated in the Best Diaspora category alongside Reck 442, Kap City, Dimitri and the scarecrow and Neville Sigauke. The awards are set to take place at the Rainbow Towers in Harare on December 12. Mlue said it feels good to be nominated for the third time in a row but this time he hopes to win. “I’m used to it now. This is my third nomination in a row and I’m happy. But this time I need to win because it’s disappointing to be nominated several times but yet go empty handed. “Being nominated however shows that my works are being recognised and are valued,” he said. The Bulawayo-born rapper who made a name for himself three years ago when he released a house track titled So Dangerous, which featured South African Smallz of the Money Maker fame, said the untimely death of Cal Vin affected his music production in a great way. The two who had a lot of music plans released a song, Thula earlier this year and had planned to record a video for the single. “When I heard the news of the passing on of Cal Vin, I thought it was fake news. The news came at a time when we were planning to shoot the Thula video. He was supposed to come this side after the lockdown so we could shoot the video. “I’m saddened he passed on before we completed our project,” he said. This past Friday Mlue Jay released a new song titled Safe and its video which features Syko Tek, Vic Jita and Rasta the Artist.
