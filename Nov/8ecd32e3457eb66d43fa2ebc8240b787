GOVERNMENT in partnership with development partners has rolled out a six-month drought relief programme in which vulnerable families would receive cash and grocery vouchers in Kwekwe urban and Redcliff town. The Government working jointly with World Food Programme and Plan International seek to improve the nutritional status of vulnerable communities in Kwekwe district. The initiative kicked off in August and 22 000 people in Kwekwe and 8 000 individuals in Redcliff are benefitting. The beneficiairies are each being paid US$12 a month or given vouchers. Kwekwe District Drought Relief Committee (DDRC) chairperson who is also District Development Coordinator (DDC), Mr Fortune Mpungu said beneficiaries were selected using a baseline survey and a ‘vulnerability analysis matrix.’ “The first baseline that was carried out by our partners targeted 10 wards in Kwekwe and eight in Redcliff. The survey revealed that 14 600 households needed assistance. But then again, another survey had to be conducted so that we meet the required number of beneficiaries hence the final list of beneficiaries,” said Mr Mpungu. The criteria used to select beneficiaries did not only centre around income earned but also factored in people living with disabilities, large families, people with chronic illness and child headed families. The vulnerability analysis matrix also included food insecurity of the household. He said beneficiaries access their money via Western Union or banks like CBZ, Ecobank and other such banks while vouchers are redeemable at selected supermarkets.
