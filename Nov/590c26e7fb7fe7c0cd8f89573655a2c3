ALL is set for the Greater Trumpet Music Foundation (GTMF) gospel festival slated for December 12 in the City of Kings. In its second edition, the festival which seeks to showcase up-and-coming talent will be held under the theme: “The Giants are Rising”. GTMF which was formed in 2018 is a 30-member group whose members range from 16 to 42 years of age. The group seeks to groom, mentor and counsel up-and-coming gospel artistes until they are able to stand on their own. Donald Masunungure aka Minister Donny Mass, one of the founding members of the group said this year, they managed to recruit a strong contingent of gospel singers who will be unveiled at the festival. “The annual festival is our way of showcasing the singers we’ll have recruited. Last year, we had our first festival which was a success,” Minister Donny Mass said. He reiterated that the festival was also meant for singers to fellowship and learn from each other. Apart from artistes they groomed, artistes Just in Time Crew (ZRP), Boss Wadaz, Simbayi, Seh Shego, Ps Gloria Makovere and Gibert Morosi, among others have been invited to grace the event. During the festival, some of the GTMF products from 2018 will also launch their singles. “As GTMF, we’re really seeing the success of our organisation as our first group which we worked with in 2018 has managed to record singles which we’re going to launch during the festival. Some of the singles are already being played on various radio stations. “Tee Marvelous Tshuma’s video is playing on Trace while Teddy Gands is making waves on ZiFM Stereo. Lorraine Phiri’s song is currently on Skyz Metro FM’s gospel top 10 chart while Lawry Chigs, Donny Mass, Teddy Gands and Marve Tee have videos on YouTube,” Minister Donny Mass said. One of the artistes who has been roped in by GTMF, Felix Muleya who is from Binga, said he was grateful for the platform and is raring to showcase his talent.
