And Biden – tipped to win the popular vote – said he was on track to win more than 70million votes, more than any ticket in the history of the country. The Democrat said he wanted “to unite, to heal, to come together as a nation.” He added: “We are campaigning as Democrats but I will govern as an American President.” Team Trump also moved to intervene over Pennsylvania in the Supreme Court. The political centre of the Supreme Court has shifted dramatically to the right during Donald Trump’s Presidency, including when he replaced liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with conservative Amy Coney Barrett. President Trump’s campaign manager also said he would “immediately” request a recount in Wisconsin, where Biden’s margin of victory was less than 1 percent. <img class="size-full wp-image-517449" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Michigan-Election-Workers-Continue-To-Work-Absentee-Ballots-1.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="410" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Michigan-Election-Workers-Continue-To-Work-Absentee-Ballots-1.jpg 615w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Michigan-Election-Workers-Continue-To-Work-Absentee-Ballots-1-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /> Michigan Election Workers Continue To Work Absentee Ballots And Trump’s campaign announced legal action over ballots being counted in Michigan. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien claimed they “had not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law”. Trump’s son Eric Trump gave a furious press conference in Philadelphia saying “this is absolute fraud, we’ve seen it in Philadelphia before, they’re trying to make a mockery of the election of this country.” He added: “The Democrats know the only way they can win in this election is to cheat in Pennsylvania. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-517451" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/odds.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="338" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/odds.jpg 615w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/odds-360x198.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /> “And we’ve seen it from day one. We found ballots in drainage ditches, they’re not letting our poll watchers watch the polls. “There’s video after video of them passing our collateral material in polling sites all over Philadelphia. “They’re trying to cheat! They’re trying to cheat! They have 3×5 printed big posters in polling locations all over the city saying to vote for Biden/Harris which is totally illegal.” – Mirror
