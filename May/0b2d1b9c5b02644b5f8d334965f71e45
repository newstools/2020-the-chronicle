THE Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) has raised more than $144 234, which will be donated towards the fight against Covid-19. Last month, the ZSE announced that it was joining the nation in raising funds towards fighting the global pandemic and made commitment to donate the levies collected from trades between April 24 to 30. ZSE chief executive officer, Mr Justin Bgoni, said the funds raised would be used to procure infrared thermometers to be donated to Government. “The ZSE wishes to advise stakeholders that the amount collected totalled ZWL$144 234. “Morgan & Company, a ZSE registered stockbroking firm, who pledged to support the ZSE initiative by donating brokerage on 5 May 2020, raised ZWL$35 140” he said in a statement. “The total amount raised, and an additional amount from ZSE will be used to procure 100 infrared thermometers to be donated to the Ministry of Health and Child Care.” Mr Bgoni said infrared thermometers have been identified as essential tools in the screening for potential Covid-19 symptoms. “The ZSE wishes to thank the investing public, Morgan & Company and all capital market intermediaries for the support during the fund raising period,” he said. The local bourse has 63 actively traded counters and proceeds of the Covid-19 cause were collected from traders on about eight levies that include Value Added Tax, brokers commission, stamp duty and ZSE levy, among others. Covid-19 was detected in China last December and has claimed more than 260 000 lives across the globe. In Zimbabwe 35 Covid-19 have been recoded and four deaths. Meanwhile, trading on the stock exchange closed the week last Friday with a market capitalisation of $64,7 billion from 87 trades. The ZSE also indicated that the turnover during the week under review was $5,3 billion while foreign buys stood at $38,6 million against foreign sales worth $3,4 million. — @okazunga
