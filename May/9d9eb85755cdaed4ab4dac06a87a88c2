BULAWAYO Athletics Board (Bab) chairman Manuel Mpofu says the country stands to benefit from the appointment of National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) president Tendai Tagara into the World Athletics Development Commission. Tagara, who has been Naaz president since 2012, is also a World Athletics Level 5 coach. “Having our president in the 12-member commission will see him gain a lot of experience that will benefit us for better management of all athletics programmes. We will have first hand information on the development of coaches, competition officials, athletics administrators and athletes themselves,” said Mpofu. Athletes seeking scholarships offered by World Athletics will now also be privy to how they can go about it. “This is the opportune time to focus on grassroots development with programmes such as kids athletics and acquisition of vital equipment pertaining to this programme. Not forgetting the role of women in athletics and programmes earmarked for their development,” he said. Tagara’s appointment comes in the same week that World Athletics is set to finalise the criteria for distribution of a US$500 000 relief fund to professional athletes affected by the Covid-19 pandemic that has halted all competitions around the world and their main incomes. — @innocentskizoe
