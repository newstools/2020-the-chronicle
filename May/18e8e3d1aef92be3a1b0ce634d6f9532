FARMERS in the Midlands Province are facing power and water supply challenges, which are likely to hinder prospects of a successful winter wheat season. To improve hectarage for winter wheat, farmers need adequate water supply and electricity. Farmers also need tractors to prepare the land for planting. The Midlands province is targeting to put more than 2 600 hectares under winter wheat this year and has started the verification process of potential farmers. Last year about 2 300 hectares were under winter wheat through Command Agriculture and private sector initiatives. Crop and livestock production provincial officer, Mrs Medlinah Magwenzi said 50 farmers have registered under winter wheat programme this year. “Planting started on the 18th of April and should end at the end of this month. To improve hectarage under the programme we need more water bodies including underground water for irrigation. There is also need to have constant supply of eleccity to enable farmers to irrigate trhe crop,” she said. In the Midlands province wheat is is usually grown in Kwekwe, Mvuma and Gweru districts. Recently Vice President Constantino Chiwenga announced that the country is targeting to produce 415 000 tonnes of wheat this year under a contract farming deal financed by commercial banks to the tune of $2,7 billion.
