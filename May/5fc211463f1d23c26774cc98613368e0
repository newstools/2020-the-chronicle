The Chronicle FORMER Kaizer Chiefs defender Robson Muchichwa has revealed that coach Muhsin Ertugral was the reason he left after a great stay at Naturena. Muchichwa joined Amakhosi in 1995 after being recruited from QwaQwa Stars and went on to win a number of trophies with the club. The former Zimbabwe national team star then moved to Ria Stars before retiring in 2004 while in the colours of Benoni Premier United. Muchichwa says he enjoyed his stay at Naturena while playing under French coach Paul Dolezar in the late 1990s. “Muhsin didn’t feel me. He gave me the cold shoulder,” Muchichwa told KickOff.com. “He didn’t feel me at all. In fact, he is the reason I left Kaizer Chiefs. The guy didn’t like me at all. I am one person who doesn’t like to go to a coach and ask why (are you not playing me) because I believe we are both adults. “I played my best football at Chiefs under Dolezar. When a coach believes in you, definitely you will be bound to perform. Paul Dolezar believed in me. He is the coach that changed me from left-wing to left-back. I don’t know what he saw in me that other coaches I played under didn’t see.” In 1998, KicKOff’s May edition of the magazine with Muchichwa on the cover smashed all records when it sold more than 88 000 copies. “It was a great honour and people are still talking about it,” he adds. “I played with the best players and to get such an honour ahead of them was one of my great achievements in football.” — KickOff
