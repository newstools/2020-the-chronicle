SOUTH Africa-based Zimbabwe footballers are reportedly working with top agent Michael Ngobeni of M Sport Management to assist their fellow countrymen stranded across the Limpopo due to the Coronavirus pandemic to return home. Ngobeni, who has Warriors and Kaizer Chiefs talisman Khama Billiat among top players in his stable, told Soccer Laduma that they are working with relevant authorities to assist some of the needy Zimbabweans that are keen on returning home. “It’s been two months now of working on this programme and eventually I have managed to get everything together. I have been talking to Zimbabwean players (in the PSL), and they are willing to help their own people return home. They are stuck in South Africa and some have lost their jobs. “Most soccer players are donating money and we are doing it with the Zimbabwean embassy and IOM (International Organisation for Migration), and I am very excited because they are under the United Nations,” Ngobeni said. The aim of the project is to provide humanitarian assistance to up to 4 500 Zimbabweans stranded in Mzansi to mitigate against the negative socio-economic impact of Covid-19. — @ZililoR
