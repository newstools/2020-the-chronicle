ZIMBABWE Volleyball Association (ZVA) has sent out nomination forms to provinces as part of its preparations for elections to be held later this year. ZVA held a virtual board meeting on Saturday and instructed provinces to hold their elections in the build-up to the national election. Out of the country’s 10 provinces, Bulawayo is the only one with new office bearers. Ringisayi Mapondera, ZVA president, said elections will be held in Masvingo on December 5. “Also discussed at the meeting were developments relating to change of dates for FIVB congress and CAVB congress. “Being an elective year for us, our own congress will be on the 5th of December 2020 in Masvingo where a new executive committee will be elected. We’ve already sent congress notices and nomination papers,” said Mapondera. “All provincial associations with elections due should hold their elections before the ZVA. So far Bulawayo is the only province that has already conducted its elections,” he said. ZVA has also resolved to direct its efforts to online courses. It encouraged provinces to use online platforms to disseminate information and to hold meetings. Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) chairman William Mazviro said they are preparing to hold their first virtual meeting. “Bulawayo has been commended for being compliant and plans are underway to hold an online meeting as suggested by ZVA. “Administratively, we have to be operational during the Covid-19 lockdown to set action plans and ensure that when the lockdown ends, we are good to go,” said Mazviro. ZVA has made significant savings in travelling and accommodation costs by holding virtual meetings. — @ZililoR
