FARMERS in parts of drought hit Midlands province have started selling their cattle as pastures decline due to the poor rains received during the 2019/2020 season. Communal farmers in areas like Gokwe North and South, Mberengwa and Chirumhanzu have been selling their cattle at below market prices saying they cannot afford buying expensive stockfeed. The raging inflationary pressures and disruption of productive value chains have worsened the plight of farmers. Midlands crop and livestock production provincial officer, Mrs Medlinah Magwenzi urged farmers to provide supplementary feeding to their cattle. “Farmers can cut grass in their paddocks, along the roads and in fallow fields to make hay for their cattle,” she said. It is also important, she said, to cull old cows, bulls, oxen and unproductive animals to generate money to feed the herd. “It is a great vision to take care of oxen and donkeys used for draft power,” said Mrs Magwenzi. Meanwhile, she said Vice President Constantino Chiwenga will today tour Arda Fair Acres in Zhombe and Loozani Farm in Kwekwe to check on winter wheat planting. “I’m glad to note that our Vice President Chiwenga is visiting Arda Fair Acres and Loozani farms to check on witner wheat planting,” she said. Cde Chiwenga who is also the Chairperson of the Food and Nutrition Committee, said the country is targeting to produce 415 000 tonnes of wheat this year under a contract farming deal financed by commercial banks to the tune of $2,7 billion. The Midlands province is targeting to put more than 2 600 hectares under winter wheat this year and has started the verification process of potential farmers. Last year about 2 300 hectares were under winter wheat through Command Agriculture and private sector initiatives in the province.
