MATABELELAND South Volleyball Association chairman Mollet Mathema says the provincial league should have started in the last weekend of March, but was scuppered by outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, a source revealed that the game was facing a slow death in the province under the current administration and Covid-19 only served as a timely excuse for them. “I feel the provincial association is not doing justice to the sport as it is dying a slow death. This is not a witch hunt, but we love the sport and we can’t afford to see it fail. What happened to teams like Filabusi, Mzingwane High and Plumtree? “When the current executive was voted in, it promised to spread the game to all seven districts of Matabeleland South, but none of that has happened. There is no certainty as to when the league would start,” said the source. The volleyball association’s districts in Matabeleland South are Gwanda South, Gwanda North, Bulilima, Mangwe, Umzingwane, Insiza and Beitbridge. Mathema, however, insisted that all had been in place for the league to start before the national lockdown and suspension of all sporting activities. “We were supposed to start in the last week of March after our pre-season tournament and schools tournament that were scheduled for mid-March. Teams that had shown interest in participating in the league include Wolves, ZRP, Colleen Bawn PPC, Jessie Mine, Gwanda State University, Beitbridge Eagles and Wizards. These are all men’s teams,” said Mathema. — @innocentskizoe
