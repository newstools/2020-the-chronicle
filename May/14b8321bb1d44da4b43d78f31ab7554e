Nqam’Ebomvu, a budding Zimbabwean maskandi artiste based in South Africa, has offered to assist up-and-coming musicians who may have been affected by Covid-19 by paying for their studio time once the pandemic is contained. The artiste, real name Onesimo Tshuma, said he decided to help other up-and-coming artistes as he was also assisted by Jeys Marabini who nurtured him and helped record his debut album. “I approached Jeys with an idea of taking up music and he took me to his studio where he nurtured me and helped record my first album. I’d no money and he allowed me to use the studio for a minimal fee saying what was important was for me to record and realise my dream. “As such, I owe everything to him and it’s my wish to help others who want to venture into music so that we work together to develop the arts industry in our country and particularly, in our region,” said Nqam’Ebomvu. As his way of giving back, the Silobela-born artiste said he was prepared to pay for some of the artistes’ recording costs and also assist with recording equipment. “My wish is to help anyone from my home area (Silobela) or our region who wishes to venture into music. I can help with part payment for recording costs as well as instruments for whichever genre they are in,” he said. Turning to his music, Nqam’Ebomvu said he has finished recording his 13-track second album titled Sinamanga Isangoma which he hopes to launch after the Covid-19 induced lockdown. Initially, he had hoped to launch it on March 30, but failed to do so due to the pandemic. His first album had collaborations with Jeys, Gaz’elimnyama and Bhamuza. Ziyacwebezela, the track which featured Jeys was a hit and was played on various local radio stations. Having grown up in the Midlands, Nqam’Ebomvu relocated to Bulawayo where he started his music career before moving to South Africa.
