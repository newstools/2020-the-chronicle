ARTISTES in Bulawayo whose livelihoods have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic are set to start getting relief today as 66 bags of mealie meal have been availed for them by fellow artiste, Sisa “Sisa Senkosi” Mkandla. National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) director, Nicholas Moyo said the 10kg bags of mealie meal will benefit artistes who registered for assistance with the council last month. These artistes were set to get relief from Government. “We asked artists who needed assistance to register with our provincial offices, and in Bulawayo we received 66 names. The names have been sent to Government for state assistance. “In the meantime however, a well-wisher has come on board with the donation of mealie meal which we’re happy to receive on behalf of artistes in the province,” said Moyo. The donation was received from the United Kingdom-based musician through her Isisa Senkosi Helping Hands Foundation and will be distributed to the artistes this morning. Handing over the donation to NACZ, Sisa said she had decided to assist fellow artistes in Bulawayo during their time of need as they cannot practise their various trades due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “I decided to help out artists in the city as I know that shows, performances and exhibitions have been cancelled or postponed due to the coronavirus which has left a lot of artists with no income for the foreseeable future. “The bags of mealie meal are just one small thing that I could give at the moment,” Sisa said. According to the NACZ, over 1 300 artistes from nine provinces registered for the Government relief fund, which is targeting people whose livelihoods have been disrupted by measures to contain Covid-19. – @mthabisi_mthire.
