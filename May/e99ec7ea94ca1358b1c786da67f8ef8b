Energy and Power Development Minister Advocate Fortune Chasi has encouraged commercial farmers in Matabeleland provinces to pool resources and invest in solar plants to enhance agricultural production. He said power supply was one of the major requirements of high productivity. The Minister said climatic conditions in the region were good for solar energy hence farmers should consider investing in that area. He made the call recently while accompanying Vice President Constantino Chiwenga on a tour of the Zhovhe Estate in Beitbridge West, where 360 hectares of land have been put under Command winter wheat. “We encourage farmers in this region to invest in solar plants so that they have adequate power and even sell the surplus to the national grid,” said Minister Chasi. He said Government was committed to providing adequate electricity throughout the winter season to support wheat farmers. Minister Chasi said farmers intending to invest in solar energy will have their applications approved in the shortest possible time. “We are prioritising the supply of electricity to farmers hence we are encouraging farmers to invest in solar energy projects,” he said. Minister Chasi said Government on its part was ready to provide land for solar plants. “It is sad to note that Government continues to lose foreign currency importing food when the country could produce enough at irrigation schemes powered by solar,” he said. Minister Chasi said adequate power does not only boost agricultural production but also growth of industries and hi-tech irrigation-based agriculture.
