ZIMBABWE karate coaches got a rare opportunity to sharpen their skills when they took part in an international online seminar conducted by World Karate Federation coaches this week. Hany Keshta from Egypt and Islam Eldarushev from Russia conducted the coaching seminar. Zimbabwe Karate Union (ZKU) president Joe Rugwete was happy with the seminar, which he described as a success, as local coaches engaged their more experienced international counterparts. ZKU has been making frantic efforts over the past few months to ensure that the sport meets international standards after the World Karate Federation (WKF) ordered its affiliates to drop contact karate. Ali Nyoni, who was part of the proceedings said: “It was a good seminar with a lot of variety from experienced successful coaches from Egypt and Russia national teams. “It was a good learning curve for all coaches. Online training is very different from a normal class environment, but there is also still a lot to learn.” Nyoni is a World and European Masters medalist, and a three-time England team champion, who also holds international titles for representing Zimbabwe and several other regional and national titles. ZKU is also in the process of setting up a referees’ panel in line with WKF standards. Referees are a fundamental part of karate as a competition sport. The panel will fall under the auspices of a technical director. ZKU has also lined up a referees’ course soon after lockdown restrictions are lifted. The two-day course to be conducted by WKF referee and UFAK Region South chief referee Sensei Llewelyn Rhoda, just before the Japanese Ambassador’s tournament to be held after lifting of the national lockdown. — @innocentskizoe
