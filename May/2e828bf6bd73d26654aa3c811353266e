In a statement, PSL spokesperson Kudzai Bare said: “The PSL Sports Medicine Committee has been tasked to come up with protocols and procedures to be followed by all PSL clubs during football competitions in light of the Covid 19 pandemic.

The draft procedures will be shared with the Sports and Recreation Commission, Zifa and other relevant stakeholders. “These procedures will be continuously reviewed and updated in accordance with the general health situation in the country and recommendations from the health authorities.” @ZililoR
