DAVID Felgeirolles, a music producer based in France has come up with a virtual song, an inspirational collaboration of 19 musicians from across the world including Victoria Falls imbube group, Ubuntu Bomuntu. Titled “We will be OK”, the song that was done in English and a number of languages as each singer used their own language, seeks to encourage people to have hope that Covid-19 will come to an end. Felgeirolles produced the song at his studio, The Future Paradise. Velemseni of Eswatini did the original audio of the song which was then sent to the others to add their backing vocals. They also worked on a video for the track. Other artistes on the track are Dominique Briki, Roger Biwandu and Eddie Delomenie from France, Emmanuel Djob and Felix Sabal Lecco (both Cameroonians based in France), Manjul, Malian based in France, four South Africans, Azah, Tshepo Monareng, Max Boba and Gally Ngvoveni, Fez Minsi and Velemseni both from Eswatini, Nicholle Rochelle (USA), Kenny Allen, an Ethiopian based in USA, Martin Barauer (Austria), Sandra Namkoma (Uganda) and Amen Viana of Togo. Ubuntu Bomuntu, one of the leading dance groups in Victoria Falls, features at the end of the video. SibangiliSzwe Sibanda, one of Ubuntu Bomuntu’s directors said the video was good in that it will help market the imbube group internationally while giving people hope of a better tomorrow. He said they were invited to add their voice aft er having worked with Felgeirolles on some other project. “We once worked with the producer and that’s how we were included on the video. They sent us an audio that was done by Velemseni and we did virtual recordings where we would send the producer our part for him to mix it all up,” Sibanda said. Ubuntu Bomuntu which has three albums is not new to collaborations as they once worked with maskandi artiste Tshwalabenyoni as well as British soloist, John Greaves. — @ncubeleon
