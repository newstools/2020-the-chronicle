The Chronicle MARSHALL Munetsi admits he’s relishing the opportunity of Uefa football next season after signing a new lucrative contract with Stade Reims. The 23-year-old joined Reims in July last year on a free transfer after the expiry of his contract at Orlando Pirates and has since established himself as a key figure in David Guion’s side. Featuring in his natural defensive midfield role, the Zimbabwe international has thrived in Ligue 1, helping the modest outfit to qualify for the Uefa Europa League with a sixth-placed finish. His performances in his debut season prompted Reims to secure his future with a contract extension and the robust midfielder admits to KickOff.com that his success is purely down to his dedication since leaving South Africa. “I really enjoyed my first season in Ligue 1, everything was amazing, but obviously there was a lot of work and improvement I had to do from my side,” Munetsi explained. “A lot of listening to the coaches, extra training, personalised training to learn and to adjust to certain aspects that are required in France. “I enjoyed learning from the coaches and players around me [this season] and happy with the way we finished in the league. “It’s always been a dream of mine to play in the Uefa Champions League, but for now the main focus to look at what is happening in the world right now and when the time comes, we will be able to do what we do best. “I’m really thankful for the way things have gone and to the club to give me a big platform to showcase my talent.” Munetsi featured in 21 games for the French top-flight outfit across all competitions during the 2019/20 season while registering two assists. — KickOff
