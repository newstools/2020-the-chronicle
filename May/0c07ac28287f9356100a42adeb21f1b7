The Chronicle REPORTS from Belgium have suggested striker Knowledge Musona could be leaving Anderlecht in the coming weeks and his agent has finally responded to talk of a possible exit for the former Kaizer Chiefs forward. The 29-year-old joined KAS Eupen on loan four months ago in search of regular game time, but with the Belgian Pro League cut short and declared over due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Zimbabwean hit man must return to his parent club. “No, we haven’t received any official announcement that he has been transfer-listed. But listen, it is clear that he does not feature in the new coach’s (Frank Vercauteren) plans and the philosophy of the club,” said Mike Makaab, who represents Musona. “The philosophy of the club is to promote young players through their development system. Knowledge had done really well at Eupen, though he only played six games before the league was suspended and then ended. In that time he scored two goals and got two assists. We are basically going to sit with Anderlecht to map the way forward for him.” Makaab, of Prosport International, confirmed that the striker still had two years left on his contract with the Belgian outfit. Musona has been playing abroad since 2011 when he left Chiefs to join Hoffenheim in the German Bundesliga and has also played for FC Augsburg, KV Oostende and KSC Lokeren. – Soccer Laduma
