A film on teenagers titled Ama2000 (the 2000s generation) is being produced in Bulawayo and is set to premiere after the lockdown. The drama series tackles teen issues in relation to religion. It has a star-studded cast that includes Nama winners – Charmaine “Venda Princess” Mudau, Antoinette Sango, veteran actor Zenzo Nyathi, up-and-coming Sailas Matsika, Sean Matsamburutsa and Blessing Mazonde. Elton Sibanda who is producing the drama series said the film was shot in the city’s central business district and Mpopoma suburb in order to have a reflection of the ghetto life. The main focus point of the drama series, Sibanda said, is tackling how youths are adapting to Christian values. “I believe that the biggest problem Christian parents make is to impose religion on their children so the film’s focus point is on Christian values and how the youths are adapting to them. “It tackles issues of religious parental guidance, sexual consent, forced marriages, teenage pregnancies and drug abuse,” said Sibanda.- @mthabisi_mthire.
