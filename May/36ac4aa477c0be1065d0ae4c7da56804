ORGANISERS of the annual Econet Victoria Falls Marathon have re-scheduled the premier event to December due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The competition that draws international participants traditionally takes place in the first week of July, but it has now been pushed back to December 13. However, they will need clearance from the country’s Ministry of Health and Child Care as well as Zambian authorities since the route goes via the Zambian border gate. “We are confident that by December events such as the marathon will be allowed. We also have initiated some ideas for our runners’ safety when in close contact with others, which we will share nearer the time. “As organisers, we hope that this commitment on our part will provide a bit of happiness to the running community, and the Victoria Falls community as a whole something to look forward to, we feel, in these negative times,” reads the organisers’ statement. They urged participants to change their flights, accommodation bookings and adjust their training schedules. Beside the 42.2km full marathon, other events on offer include the 21.1km half marathon and 7.5km fun run. The races start in Livingstone Road between the Avis garage and Zimpost car park and end at Victoria Falls Primary School. To register for the full marathon, one should be over 21 years old, while 18 years is the age limit for the half marathon and relay. Children as young as 10 years are allowed to compete in the fun run. — @ZililoR
