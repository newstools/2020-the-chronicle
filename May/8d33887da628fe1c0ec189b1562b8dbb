GOSPEL musician, Mai Mwamuka’s song, Panenyasha is topping radio charts as the message it carries, of God’s mercy, corresponds with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The song which was released last year, was on position one on Power FM last Sunday, a clear sign of its relevance. Other than Power FM, Panenyasha is making waves on Radio Zimbabwe, Star FM and Skyz Metro FM. Commenting on the song’s success, the award-winning musician said she was humbled to see the song which was released last year, comforting people during this devastating time and topping radio. “Many are likely relating to the song because it applies to any situation as it seeks to comfort one’s soul when they are going through things such as poverty, unemployment, bankruptcy and the current deadly Covid-19 virus,” said Mai Mwamuka. Because of its prominence, Mai Mwamuka said she will soon be releasing a remix of the song which will feature various local artistes. “We have redone the song with Anesu Chirongo and Lorraine Stot because a lot of people like it. Th e remix will be released soon as it is part of the Jesu live DVD recording which is now due for release,” she said. – @ mthabisi_mthire.
