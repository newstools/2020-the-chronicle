THE Gwanda Peace Committee is mobilising resources to assist vulnerable people that have been affected during the prevailing lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. In a statement, a pastoral peace ambassador in the committee, who is also the Matabeleland South Provincial Peace Committee deputy chairperson, Pastor Phathisiwe Dube said they had started the Feed Gwanda Project in a bid to assist vulnerable people in both rural and urban Gwanda. She said the project sought to reach out as to as many people as possible. “As the Gwanda Peace Committee, we came up with the Feed Gwanda Project as a response to this emergency that has arisen in our country. The country has been under lockdown for over four weeks as a way of curbing the spread of Covid-19. During this period, we have noted a significant rise in the number of vulnerable people in our community who have literally run out of food supplies. “We believe that Gwanda can unite to help feed some of the vulnerable living under extreme conditions. As a committee we are working on mobilising resources from various stakeholders. Our aim is to assist the vulnerable with food and other essential services. We have engaged the business community, church leaders, local authorities, farmers, community leaders, Civic Society Organisations, Faith Based Organisations and service providers among other stakeholders. We are mainly targeting the disabled, elderly and orphans,” she said. Pastor Dube said the project will have different phases and a particular number of households will be targeted in each phase. She said they will be working with the Social Welfare Department.-@DubeMatutu.
