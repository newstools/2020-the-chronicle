BULAWAYO now has seven ventilators following a donation of two portable ones from the Harare City Council yesterday. The gadgets are essential in assisting critical Covid-19 patients to breathe. The two additional ventilators will be mounted at Thorngrove Infectious Disease Hospital. Speaking during the handover of the two machines in Bulawayo yesterday, Mayor Councillor Solomon Mguni said Harare had done the unthinkable as the sunshine city is also in need. “We are grateful to our sister Harare for giving us two ventilators when the city itself is still in dire need of the ventilators. They have shown love and care to the people of Bulawayo and we are now guaranteed people will have access to ventilators at Thorngrove Hospital,” said Cllr Mguni. In a letter addressed to the local authority, Mayor of Harare Councillor Herbert Gomba said the ventilators were from a donor who chose to remain anonymous. Director of Health Services Dr Edwin Sibanda said the two ventilators would be an addition to two that are already at Thorngrove Hospital. “We had two ventilators that we received from the Ministry of Health though NATPHARM and these two will bring the number to four. These will be used to treat mild cases before we transfer them to Ekusileni Medical Centre our designated isolation centre,” said Dr Sibanda. According to Dr Sibanda Thorngrove needs at least 10 ventilators. He added that ventilators are needed to forcefully transfer oxygen into the lungs of an infected person who is unable to breathe due to infection. The five ventilators were donated by well-wishers last week and three of those are stationed at Ekusileni. According to council, members of the public should continue practicing high levels of hygiene and social distancing as winter is fast approaching which tends to leave more people at risk of respiratory diseases. — @thamamoe
