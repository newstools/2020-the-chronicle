THE Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (Zupco) is engaging private commuter operators to add 63 more kombis and 40 buses to its comprehensive urban public transport system to ease transport challenges in Bulawayo. Zupco currently has 125 buses and 160 kombis operating in Bulawayo. In an interview at the Zupco Bulawayo depot yesterday, the company’s southern region manager Mr Tineyi Rwasoka said they are targeting 63 more kombis and 40 buses to join the scheme in the city. “We have requested commuter operators to come to Zupco and register. We require 63 kombis in order to meet our target of having 223 kombis as we have 160 kombis currently operating. “We have 125 buses that are covering the city daily and we want 40 buses to add on to what we have,” said Mr Rwasoka. He said the move is meant to alleviate transport problems faced by commuters. Mr Rwasoka said commuter operators who want to join the Zupco scheme will be vetted to ensure that their vehicles are fit for the road. “The commuter operators will go through the process where the vehicle should have a valid Vehicle Inspection Department (VID) certificate of fitness and should comply with all material respects in terms of insurance. “The drivers must also comply in terms of valid driver’s licence for public vehicles and they must be medically fit to drive the commuter omnibuses,” he said. Mr Rwasoka said increasing buses and kombis will also create employment for conductors. On Saturday, the Minister of Local Government and Public Works July Moyo told journalists during an assessment exercise of health facilities in Bulawayo that for private transport operators to be classified as official service providers they have to register with Zupco so that they can operate during the lockdown period. — @mthabisi_mthire.
