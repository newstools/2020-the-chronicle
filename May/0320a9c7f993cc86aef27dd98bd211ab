THE Botswana government has availed funds to assist football clubs and players as part of mitigation measures against the Covid-19 pandemic that has grounded sporting activities. In a Press release, the Botswana Football Association revealed that each Premier League club will get P40 000 while each player will receive a P2 500 stipend with effect from last month. Division One players will each get P1 500. The association president Maclean Letshwiti said the money was meant to cushion clubs and players against the effects of the pandemic. “I wish to take this opportunity to convey a vote of gratitude and thanks to the government of Botswana and the Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture with the announcement made today regarding allowances availed to football and arts for April, May and June 2020. “We accept that the government is under serious financial strain during this difficult period of Covid-19. “We therefore immediately acknowledge the P2 500 stipend for each Premier League player and P1 500 for each player in the National First Division as a welcome development,” said Letshwiti. He said they had also availed P40 000 to clubs as a reprieve to help clubs mitigate these devastating consequences. The bailout comes at a time clubs and players’ representatives were at loggerheads over whether or not to cut the players’ salaries during the lockdown period. Footballers Union of Botswana (FUB) secretary-general, Kgosana Masaseng told Botswana’s biggest publication Mmegi that the players would not agree to any salary cuts until maybe after three months.
