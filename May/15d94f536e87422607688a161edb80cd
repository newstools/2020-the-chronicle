MOSI Rovers coach Try Ncube says monitoring players’ individual training has been a big challenge for him during this nationwide lockdown. All sporting activities in the country remain frozen due to the coronavirus outbreak despite a relaxation of the nationwide lockdown restrictions. “Players have been limited to indoor exercises, but it’s difficult to trace them without internet. Most of them say they are training, but monitoring individual training has been a big challenge. “We are trying to make follow-ups to see if they are really doing the training at home,” said Ncube. Ncube got Bulawayo City FC promoted to the Premier Soccer League aft er clinching the Southern Region Division One title before he quit the local authority side at the beginning of the year to join Mosi Rovers. He took over the coaching position from Mehluli Moyo, who had assumed the role on a voluntary basis aft er the departure of Gift Lunga Jnr. The coronavirus outbreak has robbed fans of watching what sort of tactics the vast number of experienced coaches in Division One will deploy. Hwange FC have roped in Bongani Mafu, Mark Mathe will be in charge of Talen Vision, Dazzy Kapenya will lead Casmyn, while Kudzayi Mhandire has found a new home at Arenel. – @ innocentskizoe
