SOUTH Africa-based heavyweight boxer Elvis Moyo has revealed his desire to exchange blows with top-ranked boxer Dereck Chisora for the Zimbabwe title before he retires. Moyo, who goes by the stage name Bulawayo Bomber, is 14 days younger than UK-based Chisora, who was born on December 29, 1983. Moyo told Zimpapers Television Network (ZTN) that he wants to fight for bragging rights against his fellow Zimbabwean boxer. He believes he has no match in Africa and his previous calls for a fight against Chisora have constantly been turned down, with the former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion saying he is not so desperate to lace his gloves for a match with “nonentities” like the Bulawayo Bomber. But Moyo, a former WBF All-Africa heavyweight title holder, has been taunting Chisora, saying he could smash “Del Boy” into pieces given a chance. <img class="wp-image-487279 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Elvis-‘Byo-Bomber’-Moyo-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Elvis-‘Byo-Bomber’-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Elvis-‘Byo-Bomber’-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Elvis ‘Byo Bomber’ Moyo “Just before retirement, I wish I can get to fight Chisora because there’s no heavyweight in Zimbabwe right now. Other than me, there’s Chisora, who is Zimbabwean, and we can have a heavyweight bill of the decade and fight for bragging rights,” said Moyo. To get Chisora, who is ranked ninth on boxrec.com from a list that has 1 322 heavyweight boxers, could be a big ask for Moyo, whose ratings have been affected by lack of fights. Moyo is ranked at 117. The Bulawayo Bomber’s hopes for a March 2020 non-title fight with Ukraine-born heavyweight pugilist Oleksandr Zakhozhyi in Germany was cancelled. He had been hoping to get at least three international fights this year and remains hopeful that he’ll get back into the ring after lifting of the lockdown. The Bulawayo Bomber last fought in May last year when he controversially lost to Arnold Gjergjaj in Sporthalle, Switzerland. Moyo has nine career wins, five losses and two draws. Visa problems prevented Moyo from fighting in Germany and Russia last year after getting short notice invites. His scheduled fight against Evgeny Romanov in Russia was cancelled due to a late visa application in August 2019. A month later he was denied a visa to fight German Hussein Muhammed at Berlin’s Verti Music Hall. Meanwhile, Chisora’s last fight was in October last year when he knocked out David Price for the World Boxing Organisation Inter-Continental Heavyweight title. — @ZililoR
