GOVERNMENT has approved a 30 percent incentive for farmers who deliver maize to the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) early. Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said this while briefing journalists on the 17th Cabinet meeting decision matrix in Harare on Wednesday. “Cabinet considered and approved the payment of a 30 percent incentive to those farmers who deliver maize early to the Grain Marketing Board in order to maximise the delivery of maize. This is over and above the maize producer price which was recently announced by Government,” she said. The latest incentive is in addition to Government’s announcement last month of an upward review of the grain producer price of maize from $6 958 to $12 329 per tonne, traditional grains from $7 260 to $12 865 and soya beans from $6 958 to $17 211 to encourage farmers to deliver their produce to the GMB. The GMB has also come up with a new input distribution programme which rewards farmers who deliver their produce to the GMB early. Under the new arrangement, farmers will get inputs under the Presidential Input Support Scheme on a first come first served basis in accordance to the delivery list recorded at the GMB collection points. In the last farming season, over 1,6 million households benefitted from the Presidential Input Support scheme. Agriculture remains a key component in Zimbabwe’s economic development, as it ensures food security, creates employment and reduces poverty. According to the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Climate and Rural Resettlement’s latest national report, agriculture contributes 15-18 percent of Gross Domestic Product, 23 percent of the total formal employment and offers livelihoods to close to 70 percent rural residents, 54 percent of them women. At least 64 percent of agricultural GDP comes from maize (14 percent), tobacco (25 percent) and cotton (25 percent).-@mashnets
