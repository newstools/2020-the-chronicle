IBRAH modelling agency (IMA) is calling on aspiring youthful models who want to take their career to the next level to register for the Miss Mpopoma 2020 pageant online. The pageant which is in its second edition was initiated in order to give aspiring models in the western suburbs a platform to showcase their talent. IMA founder Ibraheem “Ibrah” Kuvawoga said they are aiming to get 20 models. He said the models should be between the ages of 16 and 25 years. “To register, the ladies must visit the Ibrah Modelling Agency’s social media pages and send a 30-second biography video accompanied by a full picture. If they meet the criteria, they’ll be included as one of the contestants,” said Ibrah. Auditions will be conducted through live streams online from May 30 to June 5. Cautious of the Covid-19 pandemic, Ibrah said if it is not contained by September, they will have to adjust and host the event online. Those who will come out tops at the pageant, Ibrah said, will get modelling contracts with the agency to further groom and give them more exposure. – @mthabisi_mthire.
