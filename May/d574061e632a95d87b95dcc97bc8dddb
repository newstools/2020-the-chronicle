ZIMBABWE Volleyball Association (ZVA) says they made significant savings after holding their second virtual meeting through the Zoom application at the weekend to discuss the organisation’s operations. Travelling restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic saw ZVA being among associations that have embraced technology to hold their meetings after the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) held its quarterly board meeting a fortnight ago. On Saturday, a week after successfully holding an online board meeting, seven out of 10 ZVA executive members held a two-hour meeting where they agreed to frequently hold Zoom meetings. Ringisayi Mapondera, the ZVA president, said their board meeting will continue on May 9 after some members failed to connect due to network challenges. “Board meetings are held quarterly and we have eight executive meetings per year. Yesterday we had a two-hour meeting on Zoom. We are finding these meetings efficient and cost effective because we don’t have to incur expenses like having to foot transport and accommodation costs for executive members, some of who travel from Masvingo and Bulawayo for meetings. “Another advantage with zoom meetings is that it records everything, making it easy to accurately capture the minutes,” said Mapondera. The ZVA executive members discussed the effects of Covid-19 on the association and agreed that there’s need for the athletes commission to use the same platform to communicate with its members. In line with their international body (FIVB) and the continental association (CAVB), ZVA announced suspension of their programmes and will work on a new calendar after the lockdown. — @ZililoR
