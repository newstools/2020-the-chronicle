Watching the inaugural Let’s Worship virtual show on Facebook on Sunday evening, one could not help but wonder why Bulawayo imports most of its entertainment from Harare and South Africa. The carefully selected line-up of talented musicians from the city – Lorraine Stot, Faith Mucha, Amanda Grace, Busani, T1nDa and Nkosi Herman was strong enough to hold a concert that would get the likes of gospel promoter, Justice Maphosa who hosts the famed Gwanda gospel concert, green with envy. This is how talented the musicians were as they staged a flawless show. Many who watched the show live on the Fusion Media Group Facebook page asked for the artistes’ mobile numbers so that they could transfer money to them. However, the show failed to attract huge numbers as just under 200 people watched the show, something which maybe a bit discouraging for the artistes in the long run. It is hoped that in future, more people will log in and watch the artistes in action as the virtual shows gain popularity.
