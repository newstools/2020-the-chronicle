GOVERNMENT says it is impressed with renovations so far undertaken at Gweru Provincial Hospital’s Covid-19 isolation wing. A total of 10 ventilators procured by a local mining company will soon be delivered to the wing as they are already in the country. A lot of renovation work has been done to meet the World Health Organisation (WHO) standards before Covid -19 patients can be admitted. Shurugwi based Unki Mines donated R10 million towards the wing’s facelift. The isolation wing will have 14 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and 18 High Dependency (HD) beds. There will be a delivery facility for Covid-19 pregnant patients. The permanent secretaries in the Ministries of Local Government and Public Works and Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Mr Zvinechimwe Churu and Mr Munesu Munodawafa respectively this week toured the isolation centre to check on progress.
