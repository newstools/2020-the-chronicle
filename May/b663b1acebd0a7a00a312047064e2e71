IN a space of less than a week, death has robbed the Bulawayo Pool Association (BPA) of two experienced Premier League players Lamulani Ndlovu and Mathius Ncube. Ndlovu, who turned out for BPA Cup holders Skittle Inn in the past two seasons, passed away at Mpilo Central Hospital yesterday. He was part of the Skittle Inn team that walloped Lobengula Sharks 8-4 in the 2019 BPA Cup final at Raylton Sports Club. Ncube died last week at the Mpilo Hospital and was laid to rest at Athlone Cemetery on Monday. He was in the books of ZPC Pool Club. BPA publicity secretary Farai Nyandoro said: “It’s very sad to lose such veteran and gifted players in a space of less than a week. Death has robbed us of players that added value in pool.” Just like with other sporting disciplines, pool action was shelved at the end of March owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, just days after BPA’s King PC and Dropmark Pool Clubs were crowned the 2020 season-opening Beast Tournament champions at Raylton Sports Club. — @FungaiMuderere
