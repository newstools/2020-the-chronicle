“IF that is what Zimbabweans classify as a hip-hop battle, we are still in the Stone Age!” This was a comment on social media by Tapiwa Chirume on the Zimhiphop Facebook page where people were asked about their thoughts on the Stunner and Mudiwa Hood performance at the Gara Mumba Iwe Part 4 virtual concert. The two artistes have been at each other’s throats for a minute now and people have been drawn into their beef. They are the biggest names in the hip-hop industry if one looks at popularity and awards between them. And when Zimpapers Television Network announced that the Prophet Passion Java-sponsored Gara Mumba Iwe Part 4 show on Facebook would feature a rap battle by Stunner and Mudiwa, many thought this was the perfect opportunity for the two to solve their beef. Some who had not been exposed to Mudiwa’s music also saw this as a platform to sample his tunes. <img class="wp-image-268024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/08/mudiwa.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="430" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/08/mudiwa.jpg 630w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/08/mudiwa-300x204.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /> Mudiwa (real name Mudiwa Mtandwa) Zimbabweans had been hyped by the Gze and Nobel Stylz beef that had gripped the nation for the whole of last week. Their beef was indeed the spotlight that Zim hip-hop needed and although they also did not battle rap online, their diss tracks kept many on the edge of their seats. Without beef, hip-hop is a dead genre, it’s founded on this. Two extraordinary MCs spitting lyrics on the mic with wordplay, similes and metaphors, getting people to think about the bars (lyrics) trying as much to outsmart the other and gain fans. Hip-hop beef is great for the culture, it is about the competition, who is at the top and who the best is. In any hip-hop beef, it’s not about taking shots at the other rapper, but demonstrating that one is lyrically superior to their counterpart. This is how beef between two artistes is settled. Rap battles held in Zimbabwe such as Da Grape Vine Rap Battles are the pits where most commercial rappers earn their stripes. It is here where one sinks or swims and people like award-winning Asaph made their mark there. Disappointingly, the rap battle that people anticipated between Stunner and Mudiwa turned out to be an awful singing contest between the two. For some like Mc Tytoh, the battle was a total let down for the over 20 000 people who logged in on Facebook to watch. “It was highly misleading to people who are not hip-hop fans because they are meant to believe that’s our pinnacle. Stunner is a good performer, an average rapper, but the essence of hip-hop he doesn’t have. “Mudiwa can’t even finish his own words on his own songs. How on earth did he get so overrated,” quizzed Mc Tytoh. He said he was hurt that the epitome of the Zim hip-hop industry is being attributed to Mudiwa and Stunner. “That performance was a big dent on hip-hop in the country and the performances will haunt us for a long time. And because of that, it will take more effort to get people believing the hip-hop narrative.” Mc Tytoh’s sentiments, although scathing, to some extent are true. That was not a battle, it was just a sparring session. Battle rap is messy and not for the faint hearted and if one is a hip-hop artiste, they should know that this is part and parcel of the genre. Stunner and Mudiwa’s rap battle was a painful night for Zim hip-hop fans especially after watching exhilarating performances from young artistes from the Zimdancehall genre. To think that the two people who were supposed to be ambassadors for the genre made a hash of their performance is a bitter pill to swallow. Can you imagine if it was Zimdancehall being given the opportunity and their most popular proponents, Winky D and Seh Calaz (for arguments sake) had a beef, and the two botched their performances? What would it mean for Jah Signal, Ndunge Yut, Jah Master, Hwinza and Uncle Epatan? For most, they felt Stunner and Mudiwa wasted their time and what this performance has ingrained in the minds of many who do not follow hip hop is that, if the so called big Zim hip- hop artistes fail to deliver, what more of the other ones who look up to them. — @bonganinkunzi
