He says the party has lost a gallant fighter, leader, teacher motivator and a true nationalist. From the time that he joined the liberation struggle he never looked back. He fulfills the definition of a hero. He was persistent and consistent and for that I think he deserved the National Hero status. 11:52 – The programme starts with a representative of the Sikhosana family taking to the podium.
