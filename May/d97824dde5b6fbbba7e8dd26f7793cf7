BULAWAYO has been selected to host the fourth edition of the Southern Africa 3×3 basketball tournament scheduled for December. Zimbabwe won the Under-18 competition dubbed “Three Lions 3×3 Southern Cup” held in Botswana last year. Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) president Joe Mujuru said they’ve started preparations for the tournament, which they are hopeful will leave a lasting legacy in Bulawayo. Seven other Southern African countries, Zambia, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia and South Africa have been invited to participate in the regional event. Invitations have also been extended to Indian Ocean islanders Madagascar and Seychelles. “We’re excited by FIB’s decision to give us an opportunity to stage the Three Lions 3×3 Southern Cup. In a way, this will promote sports tourism. This is also good for development of basketball because people are used to the conventional 5×5 game and 3×3 has been incorporated into the Olympics, meaning there’s a lot to play for,” said Mujuru. “Zimbabwe and Bulawayo in particular will benefit from legacy equipment that includes a floor and electronic timers that will be used in the competition,” he said. In the build-up to the December competition, Mujuru said they will stage selection competitions once the Covid-19 lockdown ends. “We have lots of talent. We hope once the lockdown ends schools will open and they’ll start their games. Our coaches will scout for talent at schools’ competitions, giving every child in the Under-18 category an equal opportunity to be selected. Knowing that there is a regional competition coming in December also inspires young athletes to work harder and enhance their chances of being selected for national teams,” said Mujuru. — @ZililoR.
