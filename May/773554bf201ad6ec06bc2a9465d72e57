Meanwhile, BAZ last month announced plans to mobilise US$10 million through its members as part of corporates’ further contribution to the fight against the deadly Covid-19 global health pandemic. The health crisis  was declared by World Health Organisation (WHO) as a global emergency, which also saw Zimbabwe decree the pandemic a national health emergency to activate all systems against its fight. The novel viral disease, first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed four and infected 37 people in the country while across the world over four million people have been infected with the death toll rising above 200 000. The local financial institutions have also agreed on the need to consider provision of foreign currency to cover importation of essential items such as test kits and reagents, with a figure of US$100 000 having been suggested.
