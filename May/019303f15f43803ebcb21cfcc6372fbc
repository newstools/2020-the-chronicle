EXPERIENCED tennis coach Khumbulani Tembo has called on players to implement necessary precautionary measures when they return to the court. Tembo is a coach at Emakhandeni Tennis Club and has coached players such as Nicole Kumwenda, Hillary Ncube and Bukale Mukombwe who all got tennis scholarships in the US. Tennis is one of the few sports that have been given the green light to resume activities by the Government if it meets set conditions as defined by the Sports and Recreation Commission as well as health authorities. “We have started preparations to resume our activities but are yet to meet SRC standards so that we can get on with business. “We are working on acquiring some thermometer guns and mobile handwashing basins which will be vital when training and games start. “At this time players must get ready to return and I am certain they are well geared to start playing. ‘I hope most players have been keeping fit at home so issues to do with fitness should not be much of a worry,” said Tembo. He urged players to take precautions by sanitising and following other methods of preventing the spread of the pandemic. Other less contact sports like archery, swimming, cycling, golf, chess, darts, shooting, fencing and rowing are also among the low risk sports that can resume subject to meeting set guidelines. — @innocentskizoe
