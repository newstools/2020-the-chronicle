GOVERNMENT will this week pay outstanding Covid-19 risk allowances to non-health workers at the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory in Bulawayo. In order to ease pressure at the testing centre since the start of the testing period on April 12, the laboratory has had to rope in the services of non-health personnel. The laboratory has 48 workers and 20 are non-health workers. The non-health workers are drawn from the National University of Science and Technology (Nust)’s Applied Genetic Testing Centre (AGTC), Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA), Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) and the laboratory’s Global Fund. Briefing Deputy Minister of Health and Childcare Dr John Mangwiro and Government officials before a tour of the laboratory at the weekend, the Chief Medical Laboratory Scientist Mrs Barbara Murwira revealed that 20 of the non-health personnel are yet to be paid risk allowances. The non-health workers fall under the high-risk category as they are regarded as laboratory staff. Mrs Murwira said the 20 non-health workers have been working since the onset of the lockdown.-@mthabisi_mthire.
