ZIMBABWE Karate Union (ZKU) president Joe Rugwete says they have instituted plans to ensure compliance with the World Karate Federation (WKF) constitution. ZKU had been operating in breach of the world governing’s body statutes by mixing semi-contact and full contact karate. The WKF prohibited its affiliates from mixing semi-contact and full contact karate when it revised its statutes in 2018. This means there has to be a split in administration of the two forms of karate. “All is in order, we will be coming up with the best course of action to deal with the situation as we comply with the WKF directives to maintain our affiliation,” said Rugwete. Article 5.15 of the WKF constitution stipulates that national federations are prohibited from being affiliated to any karate organisation not recognised by WKF. “Affiliates are also prohibited from having any sporting relationships with such non-recognised organisations or with any suspended WKF national federation. Non-compliance with this prohibition would give rise to disciplinary sanctions. Illegal double affiliation would constitute just grounds for disaffiliation from WKF,” reads the WKF amendment of 2018. Faced with an identical predicament, the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee moved to split the WKF affiliated styles from the full contact styles. Expulsion from the WKF would result in Zimbabwe being excluded from Zone 6 games, Africa Games, the Olympics and World Championships. — @innocentskizoe
