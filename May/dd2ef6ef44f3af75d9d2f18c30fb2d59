MATABELELAND South artistes are contemplating holding an online fundraising concert as part of efforts to raise funds to assist those who are struggling to make ends meet during the Covid-19 lockdown. Like many other countries, Zimbabwe, in March this year, effected a ban on all public events and gatherings which has in turn, greatly affected artistes, most who solely relied on staging shows to make money. As such, artistes in Matabeleland South are looking into hosting a fundraising concert. This was said on Monday during an online discussion about the effects of Covid-19 on them during Africa Day celebrations. Phibion Ncube of Ezimnyama Dance ensemble suggested that the online concert be held because it is not known when the ban on public gatherings will be lifted. “I suggest that an online fundraising event for the artistes be held. Nobody knows when the public gathering ban will be lifted,” said Ncube, whose group is from Bulilima-Mangwe area in Matabeleland South province. Mthabisi Dube, the director of Gwanda group, Bolamba Culture Birds who was chairing the meeting said they were going to engage the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe to map a way forward. “We’d like to engage all stakeholders and businesses to join in this cause as we as artistes, are affected. So if they can assist in cash or kind, it’ll go a long way in helping artistes since we aren’t getting any revenue during this Covid-19,” said Dube. He said they will set up a committee that will approach various stakeholders. Other suggestions were that artistes should not wait to get hand outs from Government, but be proactive. Others suggested that arts groups be run like businesses and be registered so that in times of need like these, they become easily recognised.  – Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi
