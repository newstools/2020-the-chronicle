BULAWAYO City FC players yesterday received food hampers from the Johane Masowe Wechishanu Selborne Park sect aft er going for four months without pay. City returned to the Premier Soccer League after winning last season’s Zifa Southern Region Division One League title, and their potential sponsorship deal from Ingwebu Breweries was affected by the Covid-19 lockdown. Ingwebu was to cater for the local authority side’s salaries and part of signing on fees. The Johane Masowe Wechishanu Selborne Park sect donated 400kg of mealie meal and 150kg rice, whilst Bulawayo Mayor Solomon Mguni sourced $20 000 for the club. City chairman Jerry Sibanda said the foodstuff came at the right time for his “starving” players. “Things haven’t been easy for everyone and the players have been hard hit because without playing matches, they’re doomed. If it was during the games, the players would have staged sit-ins, but now because of the lockdown, they’re just sitting at home. As the chairman, I am worried by the welfare of the players. Thank you mayor for reaching out to the church and we’re grateful to the church for showing love to us,” said Sibanda. City’s donation came 24-hours after the same church donated 600kg of mealie-meal and 150kg of rice to Highlanders. Johane Masowe Wechishanu Selborne Park leader Madzibaba Mutumwa said his church will continue with its generous donations. — @ ZililoR
