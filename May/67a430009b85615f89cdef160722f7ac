BULAWAYO Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Manuel Mpofu has said that sponsors of various road races have shown interest in supporting the association’s rescheduled events. Bab is working towards meeting set guidelines to resume its activities. Athletics and all sports have been on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the Government has allowed low risk sports to resume activities. Low-contact sports like archery, swimming, cycling, golf, tennis, chess, darts, shooting, fencing and rowing are likely to resume subject to meeting the set guidelines. Bab is confident of hosting all road races that were postponed. “We do not have any confirmed dates for any events so far, but the positive thing is sponsors have promised us that if the situation returns to normal we will stage all the road races,” said Mpofu. “At the same time Bulawayo will host the NAAZ inter-provincial track and field championships in either August or September if the pandemic is contained. So as a board we are busy with the logistics so that we are not found wanting if the pandemic is contained and situation allows for sports to fully resume,” he said. The PPC Matopos 33-Miler as well as the Old Mutual Nkulumane Half Marathon are some of the events that were postponed. Organisers of the PPC Matopos Ultra Marathon have already assured runners that had already registered for the event online before the ban on sporting activities that their registrations remain valid. The PPC Marathon, which includes the 33-miler (53km), 21.1km, 10km and 5km fun run, had been set for April 4. The association said it will keep updating athletes and relevant stakeholders through social media platforms about the situation. — @innocentskizoe
