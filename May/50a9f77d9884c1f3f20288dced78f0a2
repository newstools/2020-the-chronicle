BULAWAYO Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Manuel Mpofu believes the US$500 000 Covid-19 support fund unveiled by World Athletics is a huge relief for professional athletes during this time of crisis. The fund is for supporting professional athletes financially at a time all athletics activities have been frozen globally due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Most runners depend on international competitions for a living and have been hit hard in the pocket by suspension and cancellation of all events. The National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe ( Naaz) hasn’t invited applications for the fund yet as it’s still awaiting the application criteria from World Athletics. “We are all aware that athletes and sport at large have been affected by this pandemic. Athletes have been forced to stay indoors, which is not normal. It is our hope that this fund will assist our athletes during this time. At the moment we are waiting to be informed on the criteria for athletes to apply. Once that is done I’m certain athletes will receive the money in no time,” said Mpofu. “For now we continue to call on athletes to keep themselves fit for the next competition which will commence after the lifting of restrictions on all sporting events. They should practise good hygiene and eat healthy and avoid overcrowded places. They should train very hard in preparation for what lies ahead.” The World Athletics board had targeted August and September for the possible return to action depending on the situation of the pandemic at that time. — @innocentskizoe
