Production across all major soapies: The River, Uzalo, The Queen, Imbewu, Isibaya, and Muvhango and Skeem Saam was halted at the start of lockdown in March, to help stop the spread of Covid-19.

The gazetted directions allow, among others, electronic communication services and network services, advertising agencies, film and television production companies to resume operations.
