The Chronicle In our yesterday’s publication we inadvertently published the Parliament of Zimbabwe Condolence Message for the late National hero Brigadier-General Crispan Masuku with the picture of the Zimbabwe National Army Commander Lieutenant General Edzai Chimonyo instead of Brig General Masuku’s picture. <img class="wp-image-474344 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/CHIMONYO-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/CHIMONYO.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/CHIMONYO-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lt-Gen Chimonyo We want to take this opportunity to unreservedly apologise to Lieut-Gen Chimonyo, his family, the Zimbabwe National Army, the Masuku family and the Parliament of Zimbabwe for any inconvenience this misrepresentation might have caused. — Editor.
