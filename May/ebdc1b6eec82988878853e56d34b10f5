THE Impande Football League committee is working on implementing precautionary measures aimed at protecting players and the community when football is finally given the green light to resume. The league was formed this year in Plumtree and seeks to promote and develop footballing talent in and around the Empandeni and Plumtree areas. Co-ordinator Kudzanai Dojiwe Ndlovu revealed that the committee is working on a strategy that will allow football to continue in an environment that will not expose players, supporters and the community to the coronavirus. “We are working on acquiring some thermometer guns and mobile handwashing basins, which will be utilised when the league resumes. Our fixtures guy is also educating all teams on hygiene standards that will need to be maintained at all times once the league resumes. He is also working with chairpersons of all teams to spread awareness on the virus and to encourage people to practice good hygiene,” said Ndlovu. “The league serves as a means of keeping young people away from committing crimes and alcohol abuse, therefore, we would like it to continue once conditions have been relaxed.” The league provides a platform for budding footballers in the rural communities to display their talent amongst peers. It will feature 10 teams, Baghdad, Hanyani, Kwite, Linda, Matankeni, Mhlotshana, Mkhayeni, Mvalweni, Phakamani and Silima Football clubs, which are all from Empandeni and Plumtree. To ensure that Impande Football League achieves its objectives, each team is required to register at least seven Under-20 players out of a squad of 25. A minimum of three Under-20 players should be compulsorily given game time in every match. — @innocentskizoe
