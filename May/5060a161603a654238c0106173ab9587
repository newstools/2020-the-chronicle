JAH “JP” Prayzah’s fans last week rushed to his YouTube channel to sample the tracks and videos of his latest album, Hokoyo soon after its release. This is his eighth album and his fans had been patiently waiting for its release which was delayed by the national lockdown meant to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. After its release, some of the fans sampled the tracks and videos on his YouTube channel while others shared the songs on WhatsApp. Commenting on the album, some said it was not impressive as it felt like a remake of previous albums. Some said there were not many danceable tunes while others simply commended the artiste, especially for his gospel tune, Miteuro which features Zimpraise. This 15-track album is not for those fans that want to listen to fast-paced bubble-gum music that takes them away the first time they listen to it. The album brings out perhaps what Jah Prayzah has been trying to do over the years which is singing traditional music. Jah Prayzah is at his best with mbira in his hand, performing and chanting with his husky voice over the inviting keys. Songs such as Wenge, Kwayedza and even the title track Hokoyo personify Jah Prayzah. They match old releases such as Hakata from the Chitubu album, Goto off Mudhara Vachauya and Machembere off Tsviriyo. Although Jah Prayzah said that the album is a mixture of traditional songs and contemporary, the traditional elements dominate all the songs. Hokoyo is perhaps more of Mukudzeyi Mukombe than Jah Prayzah, the entertainer. He managed to fuse traditional musical instruments with modern instruments to bring out the traditional sound hence many fans enjoy the tracks. Most songs on the new album are dominated by mbira and hosho backed by the clap and stomp rhythms synonymous with many traditional dances. — @bonganinkunzi
