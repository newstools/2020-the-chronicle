The Chronicle Black Coffee yesterday announced that through his investment company Flight Mode Digital he has officially acquired a stake in record label Gallo Music Group. The DJ is now one of the major shareholders of the piece of South African music culture and history. The award-winning DJ explained on Twitter that the deal is important because it’s not about him but for the collective of the SA music community. “Its about changing the narrative from what was a highly exploitative system, to one of renewal and fairness,” shared the DJ. In March, Gallo was bought by Lebashe Investment Group from Tiso Blackstar for R75m – incorporating it into news and entertainment business Arena Holdings. “With Gallo as one of the greatest music company’s in the world, we can start to build a new equitable African Music narrative, in an environment where the artist thrives,” shared Black Coffee. Gallo Records has been a part of the music industry for 90 years and has housed some of the countries biggest names such as Mango Groove, Nathi Mankayi, Lucky Dube and Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
