A veterinary services officer stationed in Hwange has been arrested after he allegedly forcibly entered a female neighbour’s bedroom and assaulted her while she was naked. Felix Mlalazi (39) allegedly accused his neighbour Ms Linda Moyo (24) who works as a general hand at Sino Hydro B18, of bewitching him before punching her several times on the face. The woman, who lives with her husband, only had a bath towel wrapped around her body as she had just finished bathing when Mlalazi entered her bedroom. Her husband was reportedly at work. Mlalazi and the couple live at house number 2333/2 Nguminja, Railways in Hwange. Neighbours allegedly rushed to the house after hearing Ms Moyo screaming for help and Mlalazi allegedly just walked away. Residents later apprehended him and took him to the police where a report of attempted rape was made. Mlalazi was however charged with aggravated unlawful entry into premises when he appeared before Hwange magistrate Ms Rangarirai Gakanje on Friday as police are still investigating the attempted rape charges. He pleaded not guilty and was remanded out of custody to next week Tuesday when Ms Moyo and some witnesses will testify. Mlalazi told the court that Ms Moyo is his tenant. Prosecuting, Mr John Chisango Mutyakaviri said Ms Moyo sustained some injuries as a result of the assault and was treated and discharged at St Patrick’s Hospital. “On the 11th day of May around 7.30PM, the accused person forcibly pushed a closed but unlocked door to gain entry into the complainant’s room. He started shouting at the complainant accusing her of bewitching him. The accused started assaulting the complainant by punching her several times on the face while still inside the room,” said the prosecutor. The complainant screamed for help, the court was told.-@ncubeleon
