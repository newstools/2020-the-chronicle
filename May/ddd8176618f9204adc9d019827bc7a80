The Toyota Wish which was coming from Gweru heading for Bulawayo, had eight people on board. Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Joel Goko confirmed the accident which occurred on Wednesday afternoon.

He said the driver and the other three passengers were injured and are admitted at Gweru Provincial Hospital. In another accident on the same day, a pedestrian died on the spot when he was hit by a car near Mbalabala along the Zvishavane-Mbalabala highway. Insp Goko said the driver of a Toyota Fun Cargo lost control of the vehicle which then veered off the road and hit the pedestrian.
