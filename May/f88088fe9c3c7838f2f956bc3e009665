This past Saturday, a show meant to unite and cheer up Zimbabweans during the lockdown and fight against the Covid-19 pandemic was held online. It was organised by Jacaranda Culture and Media Entertainment (JCME), the company which flawlessly organised this year’s National, Arts Merit Awards with hundreds logging in to witness locals performing. A great initiative it was as it had a diverse line-up of artistes including those who are outside the country. It was also a great opportunity for up-and-coming artistes such as Lee McHoney, now popularly referred to as Mai Noku because of her acting role on Wadiwa Wepa Moyo, to shine. Other artistes who performed were Jeys Marabini, Nokutenda, Jah Prayzah and Fusion 5 Mangwiro. Each artiste on the line-up pre-recorded a performance of one song which was to be played during the live stream. But, unfortunately, this initiative was marred by technical glitches as it had so many interruptions. It proved difficult for organisers to play some of the video clips from the artistes resulting in those who were tuned in losing their cool as their data was gobbled up, yet they did not get value for their money. This left many feeling short-changed. However, those who vented out on the organiser’s JCME Facebook page were bashed by some who quizzed if they had paid to watch the show. Those venting were quick to respond saying they had used a lot of data to watch the stream. Over and above, the organisers deserve an E for effort as the show was a great initiative as people had something different to watch and got to see their favourite artistes. Also, considering the fact that the live streams are still new to many event organisers across the region, organisers must not be judged harshly as the glitches were certainly beyond their control. Even the recently held South African Film and Television Awards had a similar challenge which saw the awards being shown on Facebook, hours after the advertised time.
