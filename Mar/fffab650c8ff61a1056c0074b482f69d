The Chronicle Rutendo Ngara,  Chronicle Reporter THE Canadian government has released CAD$3 million for food aid to help at least 55 000 people in Matobo district, Matabeleland South. In a statement, United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said the funding supports rapid scale-up of emergency food assistance. “Canada’s contribution comes at a crucial time when WFP is working to provide 4,1 million people in Zimbabwe with emergency food assistance amid the country’s ongoing hunger crisis. “WFP would like to thank the Government of Canada for its continued commitment to the people of Zimbabwe. WFP is seriously concerned about the hunger that millions of Zimbabweans are enduring and the very real prospect that their plight will get worse before it gets better,” said WFP. Canadian Ambassador to Zimbabwe René Cremonese said his country stand firm with the people of Zimbabwe in addressing food insecurity. “CAD$3 million was released to the WFP which is meant to help 55 000 people in Matobo district in addition to the CAD$1 million provided early in 2019,” said Ambassador Cremonese. The WFP also said besides providing Zimbabweans with food to put on the table and meet their daily nutritional needs, Canadian funded food assistance also provides a cushion for Zimbabweans during the lean season. It protects them from resorting to detrimental ways of coping, like selling assets or livestock which will undermine their food security in the longer term. “WFP is helping to improve the self-sufficiency of vulnerable communities by supporting local initiatives to boost agricultural production, improve access to markets, increase earnings and savings and minimise the impact of adverse weather,” they said. According to WFP more than 7,7 million people or half of Zimbabwe’s population is food insecure and US$104 million is required for food assistance during the peak of this year’s lean season. – @missngara
