I want to commend UBH and the rest of the team for the good work they have done.There is state- of- the- art equipment that has been set up inherently and we hope that this hospital will open its doors to the public as soon as possible. The kind of equipment here is private hospital standard but we hope this facility will serve everyone. It should therefore be affordable to all members of the public.”
