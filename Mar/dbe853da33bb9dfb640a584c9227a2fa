The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Chronicle Reporter THE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) said it is disconnecting water to defaulting rate payers in parts of Ward 1, Ward 2, Ward 5 and Ward 6. In a statement on Friday, the Town Clerk, Mr Christopher Dube, said the Revenue Hall will be open on weekends from 8AM to 3PM to facilitate settlement of bills. Mr Dube warned Bulawayo rate payers of impending water disconnections and urged individuals and businesses with outstanding debts to settle them or risk having their water disconnected. “The City of Bulawayo will be carrying out water disconnections in Ward 1 (City Centre domestic properties), parts of Ward 2 comprising of Northend, Queens Park and surrounding areas, parts of ward 5 comprising of Hillside, Hillside South and Ward 6 covering areas such as Bellevue, Newton West and surrounding areas. Residents are encouraged to avoid being inconvenienced by these necessary recovery measures by approaching any of council’s Revenue Offices and request to enter into a payment arrangement that will protect them against any of the recovery measures being taken,” he said. “Ideally, a payment arrangement acceptable to council involves an initial payment of 10 percent (minimum) of the total outstanding debt, followed thereafter by monthly payments of current bill in full plus 10 percent (minimum) of the outstanding debt until the debt is paid in full.” Mr Dube urged residents to visit revenue offices, district offices in their areas or the Revenue Hall for payment arrangements. He said residents can also contact the credit controller. Council is owed more than $100 million by residents and businesses. Meanwhile BCC has clarified that water levels at Umzingwane Dam are at 4,9 percent from 4,6 percent last week, instead of 49 percent as earlier reported. — @zinyuke98
