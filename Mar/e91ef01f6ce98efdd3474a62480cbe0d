Two of these tested positive for Covid-19. “Among the 65 samples tested today, was the repeat test for the sample from the individual whom we reported previously as having received an inconclusive result. Today he tested negative for covid-19. Therefore, to date, Zimbabwe has five confirmed cases of covid-19, including one death,” she said. Dr Mahomva said the Ministry would also like to advise the nation that the third case they reported on Wednesday was the following day admitted for treatment under isolation at Beatrice Road Infectious Diseases Hospital. “He remains in a stable condition and is assisting our teams in intensified surveillance through contact tracing.
