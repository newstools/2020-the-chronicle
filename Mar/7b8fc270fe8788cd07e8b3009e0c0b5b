The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO police officer who allegedly stabbed his two sons following an undisclosed misunderstanding with his estranged wife, has been ordered to undergo a mental examination. Daniel Arutura (42) who was stationed at Southern Region Transtech and was on separation with his wife, Ms Fungai Miringani (35), allegedly went to his wife’s residence in Pumula suburb armed with a kitchen knife and a rope. On arrival, he allegedly ordered his wife and two children Divine (10) and Damian (6) to go inside the house. He then allegedly stabbed the sons on the chest and waist several times. Ms Miringani managed to escape and sought refuge at a neighbour’s house. Arutura yesterday appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove facing two counts of attempted murder and was remanded in custody to March 17 pending a mental evaluation. He has pleaded guilty, saying he was possessed when he tried to kill his children. Mr Kenneth Shava is appearing for the State. – @zinyuke98
