The Chronicle Sports Reporter SOUTH AFRICA, Zambia and Zimbabwe were drawn in the group of death in the 2020 Cosafa Women’s Under-17 Championship to be staged in Mauritius from April 17-26. The heavyweight trio are in Group B with Comoros Islands and with only the top two teams in each pool advancing to the semi-finals, it will be a fascinating fight to see who goes through. Group A has hosts Mauritius, Botswana, Eswatini and Malawi, which is also an intriguing pool, as there are no obvious candidates to advance. The draw was conducted in Johannesburg on Wednesday and is the start of the countdown to the second ever championships in this age-group for women. Eswatini and Malawi will kick-off the 2020 Cosafa Women’s Under-17 Championship at St François Xavier Stadium on April 17. Group B is set to get underway on April 18 with two more fascinating clashes. Zambia take on Comoros Islands in their first game, while South Africa clash with Zimbabwe in the afternoon kick-off. With just the top two teams advancing to the semi-finals, this is a tight pool and much could be decided when South Africa tackle Zambia on April 20. Uganda were the inaugural winners of the women’s Under-17 age group in 2019 when they defeated South Africa 2-1 in the final also played in Mauritius. The Cosafa Women’s Under-17 Championship is the first of six tournaments, three each in the men’s and women’s categories, that are scheduled for 2020. 2020 Cosafa Women’s Under-17 Group A: Mauritius, Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi Group B: South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Comoros Islands
