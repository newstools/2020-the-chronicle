The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO City Council (BCC) and contractors will work throughout the weekend to get Barbourfields Stadium ready for Zifa to take pictures of progress that they will be send to Caf on Tuesday. Government has joined the local authority to avert a potential disaster of having the Warriors play their 2021 Afcon qualifier against Algeria on foreign soil. Various departments from BCC have descended on Barbourfields Stadium to refurbish parts of the venue so that it is ready for re-inspection to be done next Saturday. Deputy Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation, Tinoda Machakaire, who was joined by Principal Director in his Ministry, Benson Dube, buttressed the need to stick to timelines, challenging the local authority to move with “lightning speed” and ensure that the venue meets requisite standards. Machakaire said after Government released $13 million to BCC for refurbishment of Barbourfields, they expect most of the stuff to be done by Monday. “I’ll be able to give details after Monday because from the meeting we had, we were told that most of the things would be done oy Monday. I’ll be here again to check progress and make sure what has been agreed on is done. I’m happy with the progress made but they were a bit slow. I’m here to push them to be a bit quicker so that we meet the deadline,” said Machakaire. Procurement of material needed for Barbourfields was being done yesterday. Town Clerk, Christopher Dube assured swift procurement. <img class="wp-image-490010 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Partson-Mashamba.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Partson-Mashamba.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Partson-Mashamba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo City Council Senior Architect Partson Mashamba (right) explains to Hon Tino Machakaire (2nd from right) and Benson Dube (left) during a tour of Barbourfields Stadium in Bulawayo yesterday.
