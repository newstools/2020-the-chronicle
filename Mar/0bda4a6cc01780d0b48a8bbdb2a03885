With Daka in charge, in the same year, Bosso were the BAT Rose Bowl semi-finalists, and Africa Cup finalists. <img class="alignnone wp-image-490909 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/IMG-20200312-WA0005.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/IMG-20200312-WA0005.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/IMG-20200312-WA0005-360x270.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Daka was still actively involved in coaching Bulawayo City where he was working with the club’s juniors. His role was that of technical advisor for all age group teams at Amakhosi and worked together with another legendary former Bosso junior coach Ali “Baba” Dube. Bulawayo City chairmen, Jerry Sibanda said they were shocked since Daka was actually at their friendly matches against ZPC Hwange played on the Luveve Stadium outside field on Sunday. <img class="alignnone wp-image-490898 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/IMG-20200312-WA0001.jpg" alt="" width="678" height="439" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/IMG-20200312-WA0001.jpg 678w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/IMG-20200312-WA0001-360x233.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /> “We are shocked, we were not expecting something like this, we just heard that he is not feeling well so we didn’t think much. He was actually at our friendly matches against ZPC Hwange,’’ said Sibanda. He pleaded with football legends in Bulawayo to come together and give Daka a befitting send off. @Mdawini_29
