The Chronicle Nduduzo Tshuma, Political Editor BULAWAYO residents are hoping that the main Independence Day celebrations to be held in the city will take them down memory lane to 1980 when there was pomp and fanfare as the country gained freedom from colonial bondage. While the main Independence programme was held in Harare in 1980, in Bulawayo, residents said, there were also festivities never experienced again. Incidentally, back in 1980 local celebrations were held at Barbourfields Stadium, the venue that has been chosen to hold the main celebrations for the first time out of Harare since Independence. <img class="wp-image-489709 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/BF1980.jpeg" alt="" width="546" height="369" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/BF1980.jpeg 546w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/BF1980-360x243.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /> FLASHBACK: Part of the large crowd which could not get into Barbourfields Stadium, Bulawayo during Independence Day in 1980 In separate interviews yesterday, Barbourfields residents reminisced how in 1980 Ingwebu Breweries’ tankers lined up from Ground One to Five pumping opaque beer to residents as Government pulled all stops in celebrating the big day. Mr Melvin “Khexx” Mpingo said they were happy that the new dispensation saw it fit to bring back the carnival atmosphere to BF – as Barbourfields is commonly known – after devolving the holding of the main programme of the Independence Day celebrations. <img class="wp-image-489712 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Melvin-Khexx-Mpingo-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Melvin-Khexx-Mpingo-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Melvin-Khexx-Mpingo-3-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Melvin Khexx Mpingo “I still remember in 1980, the celebrations were here at BF Stadium, from Ground One to Five. There were Ingwebu tanks pouring beer free of charge. There was also lots of food and meat. The school children were also catered for as they were given sweets, biscuits and penny coolers. “In 1981, that changed and we were told that officials were going to eat at the United College of Education, later the celebrations were moved to White City Stadium. We are happy that the celebrations are coming here again and I hope the pomp and fanfare will also return,” said Mr Mpingo. “It is a good thing what this new dispensation is doing bringing the celebrations to the people. We also think the celebrations will be complete when the Government also ensures that the people have access to subsidised basic commodities, especially mealie-meal.” Another resident Mr Jabulani Moyo said while they were happy that the celebrations were coming closer; they should not be a one-day event but a broader process by the Government of promoting inclusivity across sectors. <img class="wp-image-489715 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Jabulani-Moyo-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Jabulani-Moyo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Jabulani-Moyo-1-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jabulani Moyo “We are happy that the Government has remembered us. Beyond the celebrations, we would also want the Government to remember us on other issues like economic and infrastructural development so that we move together as one country,” said Mr Moyo. Mr Donald Nyoni called on the Bulawayo City Council to spruce up the area ahead of the celebrations. “That the national celebrations are coming to BF is good news and we really welcome that. We hope that relevant authorities will also remember us by sprucing up the area, if you go around here you will see the roads are littered with potholes while buildings are dilapidated,” he said. <img class="wp-image-489716 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Donald-Nyoni-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Donald-Nyoni-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Donald-Nyoni-2-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Donald Nyoni “We are calling on the council to move in quickly and fix the roads because if we are to host such a big event then the place has to be presentable.” Ms Chipo Chinamora said the hosting of the Independence Celebrations at BF will reconnect residents, especially the younger generation, to the history of the country’s liberation. “Growing up, we used to see a number of events here at BF and neighbouring suburbs like Makokoba where they would erect a huge Zimbabwe Bird towards the Independence Day celebrations. We also used to watch soldiers marching along Luveve Road but all that disappeared,” she said. <img class="wp-image-489719 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Chipo-Chinomora-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Chipo-Chinomora-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Chipo-Chinomora-2-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chipo Chinomora “Now that they are bringing the celebrations here, we hope that they will connect the children with the history of the country because all we had were stories that we told them. “Yes, the celebrations were held at White City but it was no longer the same. Now the children will get to appreciate more the history of their country. “We were beginning to feel like Bulawayo was a different country as most national events were concentrated at the capital.” Mr William Manda said the decentralisation of the main programme of the Independence Day celebrations partly solves complaints around marginalisation. <img class="wp-image-489722 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/William-Manda-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/William-Manda-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/William-Manda-1-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> William Manda “It’s a great move, the decision that the celebrations rotate across provinces as it speaks to longstanding complaints of marginalisation on national events. BF was the right choice as it is the largest stadium in the city and can accommodate many people,” he said.
