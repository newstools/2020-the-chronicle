The Chronicle Michell Zvanyanya, Chronicle Online Reporter A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy was crushed to death while his father sustained injuries after they were hit by a haulage truck towing a trailer while cycling along Woodville Road in Bulawayo’s Mahatshula suburb on Tuesday. The child died after a front trailer wheel crushed his head. His body was taken to United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) for postmortem. The deceased’s father, Mr Headman Chirwa (48) of Woodville Park suburb, sustained injuries and was rushed to the same hospital where he was treated and discharged. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube confirmed the accident which occurred along Woodville Road, near the railway level crossing at around 6.05PM. He said Chatiora Williams (34), a worker at Wanjiale Logistics in Harare was driving a truck which was towing a trailer along Woodville Road when he hit the cyclist and his son. “We are investigating a case of culpable homicide where a Williams knocked down a cyclist who was with his son. Circumstances are that he was driving along Woodville Road due north. “Mr Chirwa was also cycling due north carrying his son on the carrier. When they were about to approach a railway level crossing, Williams hit Mr Chirwa’s bicycle resulting in him and his son falling,” he said. Insp Ncube said the front wheel of the trailer crushed the child’s head resulting in his death. He said after the incident Williams drove away in an attempt to evade arrest but another motorist who was following behind caught up with him along 5th Avenue in the city’s Central Business District leading to his arrest. Police later impounded his vehicle which is now at the Vehicle Inspection Department (VID). – @michellzvanyanyan2.
