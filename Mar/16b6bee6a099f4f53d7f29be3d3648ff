The Chronicle Academic activities at all Tshwane University of Technology campuses are expected to resume yesterday. The university announced on Thursday following the suspension of all academic activities on 4 March because of protests by students over issues such as NSFAS, student accommodation, the phasing out of certain programmes and student transport problems. The institution’s spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said despite ongoing engagement with student leaders to resolve the issues that had  sparked the disruptions since early in February, the protest action continued. “…. the university was left with no choice but to approach the [Gauteng] High Court [in Pretoria] for an urgent court order to prevent any party or parties from disrupting academic activities or other operations of the university, inciting violence and unrest or participating in protest or protest marches at any of its campuses,” De Ruyter said. The court order was awarded on Thursday morning. In its engagement with student leaders, TUT management said it had continuously emphasised the importance of the academic project continuing without disruption and to have students in class. “Losing lecturing time could have a very negative impact on student progress and student success rates.  Where needed, the university will assist students to catch up lost time, among others by extending library hours,” deputy vice-chancellor professor Stanley Mukhola said. Mukhola added that the final deadline for 2020 registrations would be extended to 10 March to accommodate two days that were lost when academic activities were suspended at all campuses. Last Friday, it announced an agreement was reached between management and student leaders that all academic activities would resume on Monday, however, protests continued at the Soshanguve and Ga-Rankuwa campuses which prompted the institution to seek help from the court. — Sapa
