The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls ZIFA Southern Region Division One side Mosi Rovers’ coach Try Ncube believes a lot of work still needs to be done to build a formidable side that can challenge for Premiership football. The ambitious Victoria Falls-based side aims to become the first team to take Premiership football to the resort town and recently beefed up its side by adding six players that have won the Zifa Southern Region Division One League title. Ncube is not yet convinced that he has enough arsenal to challenge for honours after his side played four friendlies against Bulawayo Chiefs, Binga Pirates, Hwange FC and Makomo FC. “There is still a long way to go to build combinations and get to where we want. We are still planning on our next friendlies and are thinking of bringing Premier Soccer League teams so that we further assess the players and build the right combinations,” said Ncube. The club recently unveiled new players, who include former Highlanders’ goalkeeper Wellington Muuya, defensive midfielder Thabani Goredema, winger Physwell Madhazi, attacking midfielder Christopher Samakweri, striker Darryl Nyandoro, anchorman Takunda Muzuva and striker McCarthy Dube. Besides shopping for players in Bulawayo, there are a number of former Mosi Rovers players that have rejoined the club, but Ncube stressed that they are yet to gel. – @ncubeleon
