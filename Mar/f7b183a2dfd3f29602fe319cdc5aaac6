Jah Prayzah’s Hokoyo album launch has been postponed for the third time due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic that is killing thousands of people worldwide. Following the ban on public gatherings, organisers of the launch decided to launch the album online but this has also been shelved as Prayzah and his band members have decided to stay indoors as part of measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. The launch of Hokoyo which was supposed to be his 10th album now hangs in the balance as it now depends on the lifting of the ban on large gatherings. “Due to the threat of Covid-19, we’re postponing the online album launch that had been set for 31 March,” said the organisers in a statement. Speaking from his base in Harare yesterday, Jah Prayzah through his manager Keen Mushapaidze said the online launch attracts more than 50 people made up of band members and technicians hence the decision to cancel it. “Initially the launch was slated for April 3 and then it was moved to March 31 and now we have postponed it indefinitely,” said Mushapaidze. — @mthabisi_mthire.
