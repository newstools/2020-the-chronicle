He feels that they are achieving their goal of giving opportunities to players who are not in the first teams in their respective schools. “It’s all about developing grassroots cricket and giving children an opportunity to shine because a lot of these children aren’t in the first team in other schools so it gives them an opportunity to shine.” — @Mdawini_29
