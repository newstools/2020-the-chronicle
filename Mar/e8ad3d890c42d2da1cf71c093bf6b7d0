The Chronicle Yoliswa Dube-Moyo ONE of my favourite looks on the red carpet at this year’s National Arts Merit Awards ceremony recently held at the Harare International Conference Centre was that of comedian, Lorraine Guyo. She wore a black velvet, sheer sequin laced off the shoulder bodice mermaid gown with feathers and crystal organza ruched flower detail. The dress was made by Ishmael Tsakatsa of the Zarguesia label. Her cinched waist gave her a polished look. I wasn’t big on her coloured braids, but I’m just glad she had them in a bun and her make-up was flawless. The other reason she probably looked as elegant as she did was because she went easy on the jewellery — a pair of studs and she was good to go. Her look definitely convinced me that our fashion policing is finally paying off! Zimbabweans now have an idea of what the red carpet is all about and what exactly is expected of them. While there were some monumental misses, there were some really good looks on the carpet. Someone should give songstress Sandra Ndebele a Bells! She served some peach magic in a Posh floral and organza dress. We all know that Sandy is well endowed, the dress did justice to her curves! Bulawayo’s sweetheart and Scandal! actress Mbo Mahocs who was also co-host on the night, wore a red Zarguesia sheer lace and sequin off the shoulder corset jumpsuit paired with a tulle overskirt, beaded belt and feather detail. She added a head piece by Rungano Rwedu and a handmade accessories brand. Overall, her look was daring. It was bold. It was different. <img class="wp-image-489987 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Lorraine-Guyo-and-Macheso.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Lorraine-Guyo-and-Macheso.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Lorraine-Guyo-and-Macheso-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lorraine Guyo and Alick Macheso Unlike her co-host, actor Leroy Gopal of the Yellow Card fame who kept it safe with a white jacket on black pants, Mbo was there to be remembered. Gopal’s look was more befitting for a groom not the co-host of a show that big! While Mbo nailed it with her jumpsuit, I felt the headgear was unnecessary. Like she was trying too hard. Still on the trying too hard note, enter comedian Tyra ‘Madam Boss’ Chikocho in one of the most dramatic outfits I’ve ever seen on any red carpet in Zimbabwe! She wore an Ivhu Tribe ensemble with an umbrella stuck on each end of the back of the dress. She said she was “making it rain”. I don’t know. She looked like a yellow straw in a bloody Mary cocktail, garnished by two red umbrellas, one of my friends said. I agree. But then again, she was probably trying to go the Lady Gaga route, but I don’t think we’re ready for that kind of drama yet. I struggled to take her or her outfit seriously. I honestly think she could’ve done better. Just like I think dub poet Albert Nyathi should’ve swapped his blue denims for a formal pair of pants. He got the top bit right with a shirt and blazer combo, even adding some pocket detail, but the jeans were a definite no no. Radio personality Samantha ‘Misred’ Mussa kept it safe in a dirty pink House of Glam sequined gown. It was ordinary if you ask me. She’s worn better gowns in the past, the Nama red carpet shouldn’t have been any different. Not too long, I was disappointed when sungura maestro Alick Macheso showed up at Selmor Mtukudzi’s album launch dressed like a vagabond. <img class="wp-image-489989 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Sandra-Ndebele-and-s-tshuma.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Sandra-Ndebele-and-s-tshuma.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Sandra-Ndebele-and-s-tshuma-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sandra Ndebele, Samantha Tshuma and MisRed Guess what, he showed up at the Nama’s in a three-piece suit! Brown wouldn’t be my colour of choice but let’s give him an ‘E’ for effort. I didn’t mind former Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Samantha Tshuma’s Zarguesia dress, but some people said she looked cheap. She went fancy with the colour — mint — but we probably would’ve appreciated the beaded mermaid gown with 3D applique and dramatic bell sleeves had it been in black. Black is always a great colour to work with. It’s safe, yet so rich. Black is easy to accessorise, and trust me — you may not need to buy new accessories to work a black dress. When a red carpet is laid, it means one thing — SLAY. It means do nothing, but dress to impress. Go out of your way to get a good suit, the perfect dress, hair and make-up and turn some heads. You shouldn’t be embarrassed to look at the pictures afterwards — make yourself a brand that stylists and clothing shop owners want to be associated with. There’s plenty of time to plan for these national events — do just that and plan. Don’t rock up in anything and give us the excuse that you’re expressing your individuality and creativity. Represent. Next on the calendar are the Bulawayo Arts Awards in August. Start planning your wardrobe now. No perfect red-carpet look can be cooked up overnight. Designers need time. You need time to shop. If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.
