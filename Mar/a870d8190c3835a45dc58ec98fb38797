The reality is that if we don’t act it will kill us. We just have to comply with the Government’s directives,” said Mr Ndlovu. <img class="alignnone wp-image-493581 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/lockdown-18-680x453.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/lockdown-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/lockdown-18-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In Mkoba suburbs all shops are closed except for Choppies which was open from 7am-11am. <img class="alignnone wp-image-493563 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/lockdown-10-680x453.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/lockdown-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/lockdown-10-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said having a single person visiting a patient in hospital is a painful pill to swallow as it is an alien culture. <img class="alignnone wp-image-493595 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/lockdown-26-680x453.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/lockdown-26.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/lockdown-26-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Victoria Falls complied with the call for a lockdown as the central business district resembles a ghost town with no shops open and only occasional human movement.
