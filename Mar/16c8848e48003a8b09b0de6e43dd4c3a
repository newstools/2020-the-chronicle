The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday sent his condolence message to the family of the late Chief Khayisa Ndiweni following the death of his widow, Mrs Agnes Masuku-Ndiweni. She was 96. In a statement, President Mnangagwa expressed deep grief and sadness following the death of Mrs Masuku-Ndiweni. “It is with deep grief and sadness that I learnt of the death this morning of the late Chief Khayisa Ndiweni’s widow, Indlovukazi Agnes Masuku Ndiweni, following a short illness. With the passing on of Indlovukazi Agnes Masuku, the Ndiweni family in particular, and the people of Ntabazinduna in general, have been deprived of a matriarch whose wisdom, fountain of knowledge and strong love her clan had grown to take for granted,” he said. President Mnangagwa said the passing on of Mrs Ndiweni has left a deep void which will be difficult to fill. “On behalf of the Government and the people of Zimbabwe, the ruling party Zanu-F, my family and indeed on my own behalf, I wish to convey deepest condolences to her children and the entire Ndiweni family on the loss. May they be comforted to know that the nation stands with them during this dark hour of bereavement. May her dear departed soul rest in eternal peace,” he said. The Ndiweni family announced her death through a statement yesterday. “It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Indlovukazi yethu, uMadlenya, uZikode, uMasuku. Gogo uMasuku passed on in her sleep in the early hours of today after a short illness. She was 96 years old. A prayerful woman whose faith and labour had nourished society in Ntabazinduna and further afield,” read the statement. The family said burial arrangements will be made public in due course as her children are abroad. “May we pass our thanks and appreciation to those who assisted during her illness and all those mourning this sad loss with us. Siyabonga bakwethu (we thank you),” read the statement.
