I am angry that he could just go before he could see his own grandchildren mature.” The service was attended by the who is who of football from the Southern Region and thousands of mourners.  Marcelene’s eulogy touched a number of mourners, who also started sobbing as she spoke.

At Bosso I feel sad that someone with the club’s institutional memory is gone,” said Gumede. Highlanders legend and Daka’s childhood friend Lawrence Phiri described him as a meticulous planner who took particular attention to detail. Former Highlanders chairman and PSL chief executive officer Kennedy Ndebele described Daka as a national hero in football whose legacy will live forever. Among the football greats in attendance that were coached by Daka was Madinda Ndlovu, who came from Botswana to bid farewell to his coach despite still recuperating from a stroke. Bulawayo mayor Solomon Mguni was also in attendance, with Chicken Inn the only club from Bulawayo not in attendance.
