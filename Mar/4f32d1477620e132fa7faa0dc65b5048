The Chronicle Esau Zulu, Bulawayo EDITOR — Sir, I am concerned about the price increases that seem to be escalating from all directions in our economy. While this may be ignited by a number of economic factors, surely some of these are too exaggerated and can be controlled. Allow me sir to pick just one such increase. The recent 400 percent increase on rates by the Bulawayo City Council and subsequent approval by the Government is disturbing to say the least. A number of questions come into one’s mind. The city council is not to blame for forwarding such a budget for approval. I have a problem with one who approves, given the state of our economy. Does one realise the implications of such hefty increases. Was this deliberate so as to erode the disposable income of the consumers and condemn people to suffering and poverty, given the amount of wages and salaries. Failure by Government to check some of these increases puts pressure on it and its fiscus. It continues to promote unrests and resources are wasted on what can be avoided. The Government is largest employer in the country. When prices are on a free buoyance the workers will inevitably demand a salary increase and the Government has to respond. It seems it has now become a culture that whosoever wants to increase rates, does so with impunity. The Government is shooting itself in the foot by this liberal and permissive populist attitude. The rates increase by the City of Bulawayo and others are just beyond the normal. Whoever approved that was not awake? Did they think before doing it? Did he read the figures? How can one endorse the misery of so many people? In any case the revenue proposal has nothing in essence to do with service delivery in the city, it has all to do with matching salaries with the rate of inflation. The rate of our inflation can be controlled.
