The Chronicle McLaren said a member of its Formula 1 team who contracted the coronavirus was “recovering well and the symptoms have gone”, F1.com reported. The British team pulled out of the Australian Grand Prix on Thursday night with organisers only canceling the Melbourne race on Saturday, hours before to the start of the first practice session. The team member and fourteen others who came into contact with him are still in Australia under quarantine, McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown said. “As a racer the hardest decision I’ve had to take, but as CEO it was the easiest”, Brown said. “I’m proud of how the whole team, both in Australia and back at base, handled the situation in a moment of real pressure and concern for their colleagues”, Brown said. “The focus, calmness and professionalism was outstanding across the team. We had leaders stepping up everywhere and that is testament to our people.” The next three races on the calendar are postponed, and they include Bahrain, Vietnam and China. F1 organisers and the FIA have penciled in the season to start at the end of May. – Wheels24.
