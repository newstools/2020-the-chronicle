Contain and mitigate: stop the spread and lessen its impact – When facing a pandemic like the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, it is important to do what you can to contain the spread of the virus, thereby “mitigating” or lessening its impact. –  To do so, there are things we can do from a public health standpoint.  Social distancing, such as preventing social gatherings in bars, night clubs, sports events, etc., is one way. Likewise, restricting visitors in hospitals and preventing or otherwise severely constraining visitation to our most vulnerable, namely those in nursing homes, while a difficult decision, is also an important step.
