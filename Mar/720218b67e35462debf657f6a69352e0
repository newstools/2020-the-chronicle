The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO motorist allegedly failed to control his vehicle and fatally hit a 57-year-old pedestrian in Njube suburb. Abel Moyo (26) who resides along Fairbridge Road in the city allegedly caused the death of Mr Walter Ncube, whose residential address was not revealed, after he failed to stop his car. It is alleged that on December 16 last year, Moyo was driving along Siyepambili Drive near Njube High School turn off when he hit Mr Ncube. Moyo pleaded not guilty to culpable homicide charges when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove. He told the court that he took all the necessary precautions expected from a driver. Moyo alleged that he applied emergency brakes when he realised that the deceased was on road. “Your worship, I saw the now deceased person from a distance of about 60 metres as he was crossing the road and he was just a step away from crossing the lane. “When I was about 30 metres away, he started to walk in a zig zag manner which I didn’t understand. I braked my car and tried to move to an outer lane but it was too late,” he said. “I would also like to let the court know that I was driving at 65 kilometres per hour which is less than the 70 kilometres per hour speed limit for that area. As such I am not to blame for the unfortunate incident that took place.” The prosecutor, Mr Kenneth Shava countered Moyo’s defence stating that he failed to take precaution in the given circumstances. “Your worship, the accused person failed to keep a proper look out under the given circumstances. “He might have been driving below the speed limit but what remains is the fact that he failed to keep a proper lookout when the accident seemed imminent,” he said. Moyo was remanded out of custody to Friday for continuation of trial.-@zinyuke98
