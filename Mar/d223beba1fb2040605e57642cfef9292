The Chronicle More than 4.8 million children have been born into war since Syria’s brutal conflict erupted nine years ago, the UN children’s agency has said, adding that thousands of others were killed or wounded in the conflict. “The war in Syria marks yet another shameful milestone today,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF executive director, as the conflict entered its 10th year. “Millions of children are entering their second decade of life surrounded by war, violence, death and displacement.” The 2011 uprising had been brewing for decades under the autocratic rule of President Bashar al-Assad, who inherited power from his father, Hafez al-Assad, in 2010 after nearly 30 years at the helm. On March 15, 2011, and following demonstrations elsewhere in the region, tens of thousands of Syrians began rallying peacefully in cities across the country to demand the removal of al-Assad. In response, the government resorted to the use of force and labelled anyone who opposed it a “terrorist”. Authorities spared nobody in the ensuing crackdown with opposition leaders, activists and professionals all being targeted. Those who escaped execution were arrested and tortured. Many of them have gone missing. Citing data from 2014 when official monitoring began, UNICEF said that “more than 9 000 children were killed or injured in the conflict”. — AP
