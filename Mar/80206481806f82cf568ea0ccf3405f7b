The Chronicle Nkosilathi Sibanda, Sports Reporter CHESS is fast gaining ground in Bulawayo and Matabeleland schools following an outreach programme by Chess Mates Academy in conjunction with Nash and Naph. As part of efforts to diversify sporting disciplines in schools, Nash and Naph have included chess and other minority sport codes in the main school curriculum. According to Chess Mates Academy director Priscah Sibanda, the sport’s popularity has grown since their outreach initiatives, with a number of schools registering to take part in the game. Sibanda believes synergy between Chess Mates Academy and schools will present life changing opportunities to players “The goal is not just to assemble children and teach them chess basics, but to train and make them play the game in a way that is going to change their lives and open up opportunities,” said Sibanda. The game has attracted players as young as six, meaning the future is bright if parents and teachers allow the children to express themselves in such a way.” Nash president Arthur Maphosa said it’s their duty to ensure learners are encouraged to take part in all sport codes in the country. “The underlying factor is to expose our learners to all forms of sport and recreation. This is to teach them to explore other talents outside academics. The uptake of chess has been amazing,” Maphosa said.
