The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Reporter HEALTH Ministers from Sadc on Monday agreed to harmonise and coordinate the region’s preparedness and response to Covid-19. This follows the outbreak of coronavirus which was detected in China towards the end of last year and has spread to more than 70 other countries with South Africa having confirmed 13 cases so far. Other affected countries include United Kingdom, the United States of America, Italy, Australia, Nigeria, Morocco, Egypt, Algeria and Senegal. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Saturday said the global number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has surpassed 100 000. The meeting, which was held at Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, noted that Covid-19 has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO on January 30, 2020, with potential significant impacts. In a statement posted by the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services on its twitter handle yesterday, Government said the Sadc Ministers of Health meeting received presentation and noted the Covid-19 global situation and measures taken at global level as presented by WHO and the Chinese government. “The meeting also noted the status on the level of preparedness of the member States in addressing Covid-19 and urged member States to put in place national preparedness and response plans as well as contingency and emergency funds to address gaps in prevention, impact, mitigation and other interventions,” read the statement. <img class="alignnone wp-image-489174 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/covid-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/covid-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/covid-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The meeting also urged member States to institute Peer Review Mechanisms to validate self-assessment reports on readiness and requested international co-operating partners through the WHO and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), to support member States in the development and implementation of country plans as well as in resource mobilisation for health-related infrastructure development.
