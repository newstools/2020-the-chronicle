The Chronicle Grace Chingoma, Harare Bureau THE start of the 2020 Castle Lager Premiership football season has been postponed following Government’s intervention as the country intensifies its fight against the threat posed by coronavirus. President Mnangangwa yesterday announced a ban on all public gatherings of more than 100 people for the next 60 days as the nation battles to contain the pandemic. “Government has decided to postpone, curtail or cancel public events, gatherings and activities,’’ he said. ‘’In that respect, Government has postponed the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF),  all national Independence celebrations previously planned, and pending International Sporting Fixtures, until the threat of coronavirus recedes. “All these activities will resume as soon as we are satisfied that our nation is no longer at risk.’’ The Confederation of African Football also confirmed, as revealed our Harare Bureauyesterday, that the 2020 African Nations Championships, set for Cameroon next month, had been postponed. “A delegation made up of members of the Caf Medical Committee carried out an inspection visit to Cameroon for an update of the preventive measures being taken, as part of the preparations for the Total African Nations Championship (Chan), in light of the evolving nature of the Coronavirus (Coid-19) across the world,’’ Caf said in a statement. “They also had discussions with the World Health Organisation representative in Cameroon during their mission which lasted 14-15 March 2020.

The Warriors were due to meet Algeria in back-to-back matches while the Young Mighty Warriors were scheduled to travel to Ethiopia next week for the Under-17 World Cup qualifiers. On Monday, Cosafa also postponed the Women’s Under-17 Championships scheduled for Mauritius in April. <img class=" wp-image-490247" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/ghytt-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="375" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/ghytt-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/ghytt.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /> BARBOURFIELDS STADIUM The Castle Lager Premiership, which was set to announce their sponsorship package after signing with their sponsor any day from now, will have to delay the start of their programme. Yesterday, the league was dealt another blow when Zifa advised them they had homologated six stadiums, which do not include any Harare venue, to host top-flight league matches. Seven clubs — Caps United, Dynamos, Harare City, Black Rhinos, Yadah, Cranborne Bullets and Herentals — play their matches in Harare. The indefinite postponement should give a window to the central government, and local authorities, to complete renovations being carried out at the National Sports Stadium, Rufaro and Gwanzura. In a letter addressed to PSL, Zifa also stated the conditions which should be met for re-inspection. <img class="alignnone wp-image-492032" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/DG-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="390" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/DG-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/DG.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /> “The Zifa hereby inform your esteemed office that the following have been provisionally homologated by the First Instance Body for 2020 season — Gibbo.
