The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter TOP bikers and drivers will compete in a drag-racing event at the Bulawayo Motorsport Park on Saturday. Drag-racing is a contest between two cars or bikes of the same engine capacity over a distance of 400 metres. There will be three rounds of racing for each racer before the knockout round in both the cars and bikes events. The top three in each category will be awarded personalised trophies, according to Bulawayo Motoring Club secretary Frances Norman. This will be the first drag race in Bulawayo this year, with three other national and the three-hour endurance race lined up. The BMC drag races are aimed at promoting two-wheel and four-wheel motor racing in and around Bulawayo in a safe and controlled environment.
