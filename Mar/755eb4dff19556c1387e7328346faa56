ZIFA Matabeleland North provincial vice-chairman Ronald Mhlanga passed away in Hwange on Friday. He was 67. “We are in pain and have lost a voice of reason in terms of football in the province. “The old man was a fountain of knowledge and his departure is a huge loss to football and certainly the province,” said Zifa Matabeleland North Province chairman Dennis Tshuma. One of the pioneers of junior football alongside the late Highlanders’ legend Barry Daka, Mhlanga commanded a lot of respect in the Hwange community and many will remember him for successfully running the Wankie Amateur Football Association (Wafa) that produced a number of stars, who went on to shine for the once formidable Hwange FC. It was through his vision that area zones within the province and sub Division Two league were formed, resulting in the first ever Division One team coming from Binga district. Binga Pirates clinched the Zifa Matabeleland North 2B League in 2018 and are now in their second season in the First Division. “Funeral arrangements will be announced once all family members have arrived in Hwange,” said Tshuma. Mhlanga is survived by a wife, five children and eight grandchildren. Mourners are gathered at number 6 Hospital Extension Road, Hwange.
