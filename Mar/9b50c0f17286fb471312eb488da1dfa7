The Chronicle Australians have been panic-buying packs of condoms, believing they will help protect against coronavirus. Thanh Thai, from Sydney, shared a picture of empty shelves after a store sold out of Durex contraceptives. ‘Can anybody please tell me what happened?’ she wrote alongside the picture. Other mums told her that the panic-buying comes after a social media post encouraged people to use condoms to protect their fingers against the virus. Thanh Thai took to the Ryde’s District Mum’s Facebook page to a picture of share empty shelves after a store sold out of the latex contraceptives. ‘There has been some stupid post telling people to put condoms on their fingers to press buttons etc,’ one user replied. ‘Perhaps a new marketing ploy, just use your clothed elbow to avoid more rubbish being placed in the environments,’ another added. ‘Beyond ridiculous,’ another added. Many Australian shoppers are stocking up on groceries over fears of food shortages due to the outbreak of the virus. Images have shown empty shelves and trolleys filled to the brim at major supermarkets such as Coles and Woolworths as people rush to fill their pantries. Mail Online
