The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO woman has been granted a protection order against her grandson who habitually insults and steals her property. Ms Anna Sibanda, whose age was not revealed in court, but is from New Magwegwe suburb, said she was tired of Xolani Nyathi’s insults and wanted him to be banned from coming to her house. “We have been staying together with the respondent from the time his mother died but now he disrespects me in my own house. “When I ask him where he is coming from late at night, he insults me using vulgar language and says he was with his friends,” she said. Ms Sibanda said her grandson steals and sells her property. “I pray that the court may grant me a protection order so that he stops insulting and threatening me. May he also be banned from coming to my house,” she said. Western Commonage magistrate Mr Jeconiah Ncube granted an interim protection order prohibiting Nyathi from verbally or emotionally abusing his grandmother. “The respondent is ordered not to visit the complainant’s place of residence in Magwegwe suburb,” he said. Another protection order was granted to Trish Bhariwa of Pumula East suburb against her brother Carlton Bhariwa. Ms Bhariwa stated that she was now living in fear as her brother was violent and continuously threatened her peace.
