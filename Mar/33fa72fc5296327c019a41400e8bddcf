The Chronicle Callum Hudson-Odoi appears to be on the mend following his positive coronavirus test as he posted a video of him working out on a stationary bike at home. The Chelsea winger was the first Premier League player to test positive for Covid-19, but in a video last Friday announced that he had recovered from the illness. And on Monday evening, the 19-year-old showed just how quickly he had recovered by posting a workout on a stationary bike on his Instagram story, saying “Stay home, but find a way to work!” Hudson-Odoi experienced cold-like symptoms last Monday and his test showed he had contracted Covid-19. At that point, the entire first-team squad at Chelsea and some of Frank Lampard’s staff self-isolated after coming into contact with the winger. Yet last Friday, Hudson-Odoi was upbeat saying he had recovered from the virus. “Hi guys, as you may be aware I had the virus for the last couple of days, which I’ve recovered from,” he said in a video sent from self-isolation. “I’m following the health guidelines and self-isolating myself from everybody for the week. “I hope to see everybody soon and hope to be back on the pitch very soon.” Hudson-Odoi has not played since a 2-2 draw with Leicester on February 1. Premier League football was suspended last week until at least April 4 following the news that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta had contracted coronavirus. — Sportsmail
