The Chronicle Zimbabwe, which like the rest of the world, immediately took measures to counter the spread of the deadly coronavirus which has been named Covid-19 by the World Health Organisation, on Tuesday escalated the fight against the pandemic to another level when it declared the outbreak aÂ  state of national disaster. This will enable Government to mobilise resources and take necessary measures in dealing with Covid-19. Zimbabwe, although it is among the countries that are free of Covid-19, has resolved to take measures to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus given the fact that countries in the Sadc region including neighbouring South Africa already have confirmed cases. President Mnangagwa on Tuesday announced the postponement of major social events that include the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair and the 40th Independence Day celebrations that were scheduled for Bulawayo next month. All pending international sporting fixtures have also been postponed until the threat of coronavirus recedes. Government has also banned public gatherings of more than 100 people including for religious purposes for the next 60 days as part of a raft of measures aimed to minimising the risk of exposure to Covid-19. <img class="alignnone wp-image-492057" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Coronavirus-2-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="387" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Coronavirus-2-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Coronavirus-2.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /> President Mnangagwa said more isolation centres were being identified and he has directed the National Disaster Management Machinery to extend its mandate and focus on dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. He said all hospitals have now been put on high alert to enable them to deal with the threat of Covid-19. Government premises are being equipped for screening procedures and companies as well as other organisations have been urged to do the same to ensure a total and effective response to the coronavirus. Government continues to curtail unnecessary travel outside the country especially to destinations in countries affected by the virus and is also encouraging travellers from high risk countries to postpone their visit to Zimbabwe for the next 30 days. The measures that Zimbabwe and the rest of the world are taking to contain the spread of Covid-19 might be viewed as harsh but are necessary to counter this new global threat to human life. The rate at which the virus is spreading and killing people calls for extraordinary measures to contain it. It is therefore incumbent upon each and every Zimbabwean to take measures to minimise risk of exposure to Covid-19 which, as already witnessed in the affected countries, spreads very fast and has very high mortality rate. We totally agree with the President that this new global challenge calls for unity of purpose if Zimbabwe is to remain free of the virus. Citizens must be vigilant and should not hesitate to report any suspected symptoms to health authorities for swift reaction. It is a fact that the Zimbabwean economy like the rest of the world has already been adversely affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus and the situation will be worsened by the measures announced on Tuesday to address this global threat. It is our hope that the situation will improve in the shortest possible time and that we remain virus free. We want to commend companies and NGOs that are already complementing Government efforts to raise awareness on the pandemic and urge them to do more especially for people in rural areas.
