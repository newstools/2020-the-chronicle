The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS’ supporters have called for the arrest and naming of unruly elements responsible for disturbances that rocked Barbourfields Stadium on Saturday during the Castle Challenge Cup between Bosso and FC Platinum. <img class="alignnone wp-image-491828 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Bosso-FC-Platinum-violence-87.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Bosso-FC-Platinum-violence-87.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Bosso-FC-Platinum-violence-87-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The game, which FC Platinum won 2-0, was marred by violence, adding to Bosso’s financial woes after the Premier Soccer League moved to charge the Bulawayo giants. Every season Bosso has to budget for fines due to some of the club’s wayward fans that resort to hooliganism when the team loses. <img class="alignnone wp-image-491803 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Bosso-FC-Platinum-violence-76.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Bosso-FC-Platinum-violence-76.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Bosso-FC-Platinum-violence-76-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fans that have grown tired of hooliganism took to Facebook to vent their frustrations. “The police, PSL and Zifa must work together and take action against identified hooligans. We are trying to make Barbourfields an international venue only for hooligans to ruin those endeavours,” said one fan Sineke Maseko. <img class="alignnone wp-image-491753 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Bosso-FC-Platinum-violence-52.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Bosso-FC-Platinum-violence-52.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Bosso-FC-Platinum-violence-52-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandidi Mushavi Horanzi said those photographed on the pitch must be brought to book, as they were all over the place.
