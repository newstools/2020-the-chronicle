The Chronicle How does Covid-19 spread? Covid-19 can be transmitted from a person who has the virus to others who don’t have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with Covid-19 coughs, sneezes or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Therefore, it is important to stay more than one metre away from a person who is sick. Other people can catch Covid-19 by touching contaminated objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. However, since this is a new virus, ongoing research in currently taking place on the methods of Covid-19 transmission and WHO will continue to share updated findings. What can I do to protect myself and reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection? You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading Covid-19 by taking some simple precautions which include: – Avoid close contact with anyone with a cold or flu-like illness. Maintain at least 1m distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing – Regularly and thoroughly cleaning your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. – Practice good cough etiquette and good respiratory hygiene by covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. – Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. This is because hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. – Avoid unnecessary travel to countries with confirmed Covid-19 cases. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, seek medical attention early and call the health facility in advance. Depending on your history, this will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. — WHO
