The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter ADEQUATE supply of infrastructure services is an essential ingredient for productivity and sustained economic growth and the attainment of Vision 2030, a Cabinet Minister has said. Officiating at the South Africa-Zambia and Zimbabwe Infrastructure Summit and Expo yesterday, Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo said Zimbabwe has vast resources which can be exploited through partnerships. “As you are aware, distinguished guests, Zimbabwe’s Transitional Stabilisation Programme is hinged on the collective determination and aspiration of the people of Zimbabwe for a prosperous and empowered Upper Middle-Income society by 2030. One of the anchors of Vision 2030 is the creation of a competitive and friendly business environment and this can only be achieved with infrastructure investments taking centre stage to enable economic engines to fully function. “A report produced by the Government in collaboration with Africa Development Bank (AfDB), United Nations and the World Bank Group in 2019 indicates that adequate supply of infrastructure services is an essential ingredient for productivity and sustained growth. “We, therefore, welcome an approach which promotes increased investment linked with rehabilitation of our transport infrastructure which encompasses road, rail and aviation, as well as power generation,” said Minister Moyo. He said the summit was timely for Zimbabwe as the country is also seized with programmes which seek to enhance the built environment and improve infrastructure pursuant to vision 2030.-@ncubeleon
