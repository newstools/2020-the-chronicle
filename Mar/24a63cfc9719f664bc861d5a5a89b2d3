The Chronicle Real Madrid have reopened the door for Gareth Bale to leave but his mammoth wages will make a Premier League return impossible. The Welshman has been unhappy in Spain for some time and has fallen down the pecking order since Zinedine Zidane’s return last season. Zidane is said to have a fractious relationship with Bale and attempted to force him out last summer — something the player felt was “professional abuse”. Bale has made just 18 appearances across all competitions and reports in Spain claim that Madrid are now desperate to get him off their wage bill. The 30-year-old, who earns £13.4 million a season, came close to joining Chinese Super League side Jiungsu Suning last summer but the deal fell through before it was finalised. Tottenham have also been heavily linked with re-signing Bale for much of this season but AS are reporting that Bale’s agent is aware a return to the Premier League is highly unlikely due to his wages. Jiungsu Suning were the only concrete offer on the table for Bale last summer and there is uncertainty over the forward’s next destination. AS claim the MLS is the most likely place for Bale with Madrid determined this summer will be the one they finally manage to offload him. Bale joined Madrid in 2013 in a big-money deal from Tottenham but despite an auspicious start, things have turned sour for him in Spain. He has struggled to endear himself to Madrid’s supporters and has been plagued by injuries over the      past few years while Bale has also come under regular criticism for his failure to learn Spanish, something which has reportedly alienated him in the dressing room. Madrid would be willing to keep Bale if he would lower the salary on his deal, which currently runs until 2022, but he has so far refused to do that. The Spanish giants are also keen to sell Luka Jovic this summer with the striker scoring just twice since joining from Frankfurt last year. — mailonline
