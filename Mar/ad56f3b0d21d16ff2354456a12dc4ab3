The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke/Rutendo Ngara, Court Reporters A HARARE man who was arrested for a number of fraud cases involving about US$60 000, has been denied bail in a case in which he allegedly duped a Bulawayo man of more than RTGS$170 000 Malvin Mutanda alias Gerald Magaya (33) of Kambuzuma suburb who claimed to be a brother to Prophet Walter Magaya, allegedly misrepresented that he could get US dollars for the man whose name and residential address were not revealed in court. Mutanda appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Lizwe Jamela facing fraud charges and was remanded in custody to March 11. Denying Mutanda bail, Mr Jamela said having multiple identities confirmed fears that if granted bail Mutanda could commit other offences. He said what made the situation worse for Mutanda was that his accomplice was still at large. Mutanda who claimed to work for an unnamed Non-Governmental Organisation was in the company of an unidentified accomplice who is still at large when they allegedly defrauded the complainant. He was however arrested on the same day and when he was searched he was found with $4 000 and two national identity cards bearing different names but with his face. Prosecuting, Mr Terrence Chakabuda called on the court to deny Mutanda bail as he committed the offence while on bail for two other fraud cases committed in Harare.
