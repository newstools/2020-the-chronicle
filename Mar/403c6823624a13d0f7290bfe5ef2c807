The Chronicle In terms of awareness, this is a continuous process and we have prepared for printing information, education and communication materials for radio, television and other media blitz and job ads to assist medical and laboratory staff.  I am sure we have all seen on television, WhatsApp and SMS messages which are being relayed regarding personal hygiene. One other issue which we have taken care of Madam President is that of protecting our staff.  All those who are working at the borders, we have ensured that they are well protected. We are ensuring that all our staff is well trained in terms of protection.  We do not want to end up with our own personnel being infected by the Covid-19. <img class=" wp-image-415774" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/obadiah-moyo-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="387" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/obadiah-moyo-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/obadiah-moyo.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /> Minister Dr Obadiah Moyo We have job ads, strategies, supplies of recommended medicines which are prepositioned.  We have personal protective equipment, test kits and other requirements for managing any of the cases. They must be adequately protected so that they render the services properly. We have constantly engaged the media in order to keep the population of Zimbabwe updated as the outbreak of the virus has been evolving.  As a new disease, there is quite a lot that we now know but there is still a lot that we do not know.  My team of experts will continue getting the updates from WHO, the African Union Centre for Disease Control and continue passing on information using the various communication platforms. –Minister of Health and Child Care Dr Obadiah Moyo
