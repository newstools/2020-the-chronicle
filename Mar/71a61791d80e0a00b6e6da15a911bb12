The Chronicle Chronicle Reporters THE Presidium has moved to promote the national clean-up campaign beyond the country’s major cities as it seeks to ensure that the programme is embraced by citizens at grassroots levels. President Mnangagwa leads today’s campaign from Gutu-Mpandawana in Masvingo province as his deputies, Dr Constantino Chiwenga and Cde Kembo Mohadi, lead the process in Mashonaland Central and Matabeleland North. The President in 2018 declared the first Friday of each calendar month, the National Environment Cleaning Day, as his Government moves to ensure the country has sustainable environment management and waste disposal systems. Since then the country has been religiously conducting the national clean-up campaign. <img class="wp-image-486281 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Vp-Mohadi-Matobo-clean-up.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Vp-Mohadi-Matobo-clean-up.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Vp-Mohadi-Matobo-clean-up-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> FILE PICTURE: Vice President Kembo Mohadi (right) picks up litter during the clean-up campaign at Maphisa Business Centre in Matobo District in Matabeleland South. Authorities have said the programme has started bearing fruits since its inception. Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Mangaliso Nqobizitha Ndlovu yesterday said President Mnangagwa and his deputies are determined in ensuring the success of the programme at grassroot levels. “The Presidium is now spreading the clean-up campaign to other provinces outside the two metropolitan provinces of Bulawayo and Harare among other cities. This is to ensure that every citizen gets down and ensures that their environs are clean.  “As it stands, President Mnangagwa would be in Gutu-Mpandawana in Masvingo. It’s a small town, we can’t say it’s a growth point anymore. Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga would be in Mashonaland Central, VP Kembo Mohadi will be in Matabeleland North,” said Minister Ndlovu.  <img class="wp-image-476792 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Chiwenga-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Chiwenga.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Chiwenga-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vice President Constantino Chiwenga He said since the inception of the programme, it has been focused on major cities but these are not the only areas that require cleanliness.
