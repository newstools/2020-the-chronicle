The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma recently in Tsholotsho LOCAL authorities should quickly channel devolution funds towards development projects before the money loses value due to prevailing inflationary pressures, Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs Minister, Richard Moyo, has said. Speaking during the official commissioning of Pateni Dam at Dikili Village in Ward 19 in Tsholotsho last week, Minister Moyo said most councils were guilty of letting funds devalue at banks because of delays in utilising them. Pateni Dam was built in May 2019 and completed in September of the same year at a cost of over US$50 000, funded by Amalima and partners. “There is money, which comes every year to councils meant for devolution that should be utilised when we have such partners like Amalima who come on board to facilitate development in our areas. “The problem with other councils is that the devolution money comes and they bank it for a long period. “As we are facing an economic crisis where there is inflation, we are emphasising that the devolution money be utilised on the go before it loses value,” said Minister Moyo. <img class=" wp-image-492770" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/moyo-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="390" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/moyo-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/moyo.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /> “I heard you want a dip tank and since you now have a dam, the council should see to it that the dip tank is built using the devolution money.”
