The Chronicle A Polish woman has been left completely blind in one eye when she tried to dye her eyeballs black. After a visit to a tattoo parlour in Warsaw, Aleksandra Sadowska — a 25-year-old model — started complaining of pain in her eyes, which the tattooist said was normal and could be treated with painkillers, according to the Daily Mail. After losing her sight completely in her right eye she was told by doctors that the damage was irreparable, and she’d soon lose sight in her left eye too. The tattoo artist, named in local media as Piotr A, is now facing three years in prison for unintentionally disabling Aleksandra. During a subsequent investigation it was found he made serious errors during the procedure, including using body ink which isn’t meant for the eyes. “There’s clear evidence that the tattoo artist didn’t know how to perform such a delicate procedure,” Aleksandra’s lawyer told local media. “And yet he decided to perform it, which led to this tragedy.” Sclera tattooing, also known as tattooing the whites of the eyes, is a risky one and isn’t encouraged by medical experts. “I’d strongly recommend against it,” says ophthalmologist Philip Rizzuto, a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Aleksandra, who says she wanted the procedure to emulate a Polish rap artist called Popek, says she won’t let this deter her in life. “I won’t lock myself in the basement and get depressed. I have sadness behind me, but I live on.” — Daily Mail
