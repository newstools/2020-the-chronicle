The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE Zimbabwean embassy in South Africa has sent a team led by Consul General, Mrs Melody Chaurura, to Musina to help with the identification process following the death of seven Zimbabweans in an accident on Sunday night. The tragic incident occurred some 5km after the Beitbridge Border Post along the N1 highway. The seven, among them a two-year-old toddler, are believed to be from Chiredzi District.

On behalf of the Government and Embassy staff, I want to express our heartfelt condolences and may they find comfort in God during this tragic moment,” said Zimbabwe’s envoy to Pretoria, Mr David Hamadziripi. “We have sent a team led by our Consul General (Mrs Chaurura) to liaise with local police and other authorities and help with identification and repatriation processes. Our objective is to make the whole processes seamless and ensure that our fellow countrymen are repatriated as soon as possible and are afforded decent burial back home.” Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo yesterday confirmed that all the victims were Zimbabweans and that they were in the process of notifying their next of kin.
