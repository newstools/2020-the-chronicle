The Chronicle While PSL players will still be earning their pay cheques come the end of the month, match officials will be left out in the cold. South African Football Association head of referees Tendai Masikhwa has bemoaned the fact that referees will bear the brunt of the pandemic as they are not permanently employed by the governing body and are remunerated according to the number of matches they officiate. “You know their contract is just a contract for them to say they are getting paid as and when they work,” Masikhwa told Goal. “I think the president [Danny Jordaan] has released a statement that money is not an issue but their safety is and that is what we must be all concerned about. So, that is why we are saying they are not supposed to be officiating anyway because the matches are suspended.” “The referees are affected just like everyone else, we cannot expose them to such danger and we have to practice safety at all times — that is the priority,” Masikhwa told Goal. Masikhwa did acknowledge that referees faced less risk of contracting the virus as they do not train in groups like the players. “What they must be doing now is all about keeping fit and safe from the disease. In fact, referees are better off compared to the players because they usually train alone than when  you compare with the players, who train as a team. “They can still train outdoors and remain fit and whenever the games continue, they can hit the ground running,” added Masikhwa. — Sport24
