The Chronicle Vusumuzi Dube, Senior Reporter BULAWAYO City Council (BCC) which together with the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) and Government are chasing a tight deadline for the renovation of Barbourfields Stadium, requires more than $200 000 a month to maintain its three major stadia in the city. The Confederation of African Football has banned Barbourfields Stadium from hosting international matches just a month before BF was due to host a Caf Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between the Warriors and Algeria.  <img class=" wp-image-490248" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/LUVEVE-STADIUM.-INCOME-IN-2019-23-528-HIRE-CHARGE-6-977-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="387" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/LUVEVE-STADIUM.-INCOME-IN-2019-23-528-HIRE-CHARGE-6-977-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/LUVEVE-STADIUM.-INCOME-IN-2019-23-528-HIRE-CHARGE-6-977.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /> LUVEVE STADIUMINCOME IN 2019: $23 528HIRE CHARGE: $6 977 It has since emerged that the local authority is not raising much from the hire of its three major stadia — Barbourfields, Luveve and White City. The local authority’s senior public relations officer Nesisa Mpofu said council requires more than $280 000 a month to maintain the three facilities. This figure translates to more than $3 million a year just for maintenance. “Last year alone the local authority managed to raise $332 418 from use of the stadiums with Barbourfields contributing the largest chunk at $303 890. Luveve Stadium raised $23 528 while White City Stadium had a minimal contribution of $5 000,” said Mpofu.  <img class=" wp-image-490251" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/WHITE-CITY-STADIUM.-INCOME-IN-2019-5-000-HIRE-CHARGE-6-977-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="387" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/WHITE-CITY-STADIUM.-INCOME-IN-2019-5-000-HIRE-CHARGE-6-977-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/WHITE-CITY-STADIUM.-INCOME-IN-2019-5-000-HIRE-CHARGE-6-977.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /> WHITE CITY STADIUMINCOME IN 2019: $5 000HIRE CHARGE: $6 977 This means the local authority is operating the three stadiums at a deficit of more than $3 million thereby relying on ratepayers’ money to continue running the facilities. Mpofu said council charged $23 249 for the hire of Barbourfields while for both White City and Luveve the charge is $6 977. “As per our 2020 budget we aim to spend $967 855 for repairs and maintenance and $1 329 990 for the purchase of furniture and equipment. In terms of upgrading of the three stadia under our capital budget we expect to spend $165 000 000,” said Mpofu. Government has released $13 million to fund the upgrading of Barbourfields, ahead of the Warriors’ Afcon qualifier but council says it needs $58 million to complete the required renovations.
