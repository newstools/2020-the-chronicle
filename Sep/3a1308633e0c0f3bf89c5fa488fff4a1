Musician Nox Guni has celebrated a milestone after his yesteryear hit — Ndinonyara — clocked a million views on YouTube recently. Oddly enough, the video premiered on YouTube on February 16, 2012. What is all the more startling is that Nox thanked fans for the ‘million milestone’ considering other local videos. Top artistes as big as Jah Prayzah and Winky D are now talking of 100 million views, for Nox this was a BIG deal although it took eight years for Ndinonyara video to amass 1 million views when his contemporaries do that in hours or just a day. The music scene has changed over the years and many musicians are now trending with the release of their new music. A song has to be that good for it to trend or at least be in the top five trending videos for musicians to earn big otherwise the wish wash won’t survive. The case in point is Jah Master whose video Hello Mwari has scaled dizzy heights with more cover versions coming his way. The song has since gone viral on social media becoming a cross over song.
