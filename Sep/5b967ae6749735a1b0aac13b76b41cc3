ORGANISERS of the 10th edition of the Shoko Festival have revealed that this year’s edition will be held virtually and will feature an array of artistes drawn from across the country. In a statement, Shoko Festival director, Comrade Fatso said the week-long event which kicks off on September 21 will be live-streamed with the festival’s theme “Phoenix Edition” having been inspired by the ongoing pandemic that has greatly affected the arts. “This year’s theme comes as a revelation for people to rise uniquely above coronavirus like the phoenix (mythological bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again) does through creating an inspirational artistic space. We’re calling on Zimbabweans to come alive and see beyond the Covid-19 pandemic and challenging times we are living in,” said Comrade Fatso. “Challenges are prone to be there in any scenario and can be hard to move past, but this is an opportunity to relive the dreams we’ve always had through a pulsating, corporeal eruption of music, comedy, free expression and inspiring vibes.” <img class="wp-image-503359 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/6908D774-3367-4487-8169-3398FE0984E8.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/6908D774-3367-4487-8169-3398FE0984E8.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/6908D774-3367-4487-8169-3398FE0984E8-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Poptain The organisers said the festival aims at giving up-and-coming artistes in different genres an opportunity to perform.
