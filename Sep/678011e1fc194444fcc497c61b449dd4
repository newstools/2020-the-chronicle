HOSPITALITY group, African Sun, will re-open three of its flagship hotels this week with specials meant to attract clients as the company slowly returns to business after a six-month lockdown caused by Covid-19. Africa Sun closed its hotels countrywide on March 30 in line with national lockdown regulations, resulting in hundreds of workers staying at home. The group has been operating at low capacity lately after taking a decision to re-open some of its hotels on a phased approach. Its Holiday Inn Harare, Holiday Inn Mutare, Holiday Inn Bulawayo and Great Zimbabwe Hotel in Masvingo re-opened in May. The hospitality group said it will be reopening Elephant Hills Resort and Conference Centre and The Kingdom Hotel both in Victoria Falls and Hwange Safari Lodge on October 1, the same day airlines are expected to resume flights. The group pins its hopes on resumption of regional and international flights. The Ethiopian Airways has already scheduled its first flight to Victoria Falls for next week Tuesday. Air Zimbabwe has already resumed domestic flights. Government has also allowed domestic inter-city travel thereby bringing hope to the hospitality and tourism industry. In a trading update, the African Sun group advised clients to make business or leisure bookings at its facilities at special rates, which will run for a couple of weeks until November 30 and exclude weekends. â€” @ncubeleon
