THE Environmental Management Agency (Ema) has recorded a 16 percent decrease in the size of land destroyed by veld fires across the country since the onset of the fire season on July 31 compared to the same period last year. One death related to a veld fire has been recorded from July 31 to August 31 compared to the same period last year when two deaths were recorded. The country is this year targeting a 25 percent decrease in the amount of land destroyed by veld fires. In a statement, the organisation’s Environmental Education and Publicity manager, Ms Amkela Sidange said since the beginning of the 2020 fire season to August 31, a total of 320 fire incidences which destroyed 175 259.91 hectares of land were recorded. She said during the same period in 2019, a total of 549 fire incidences were recorded which burnt a total of 210 530.74 hectares. “Since the beginning of the 2020 fire season on 31 July, a total of 320 fire incidences which destroyed 175 259.91 hectares of land have been recorded. During the same period in 2019 a total of 210 530.74 hectares were burnt from 549 fire incidences recorded which translates to 16.75 percent decrease in area burnt during same period in 2020. “The most affected provinces to date are Mashonaland West where 39.8 percent of veld fires losses were recorded followed by Mashonaland Central with 18.2 percent and Mashonaland East with 17.1 percent,” she said. “Unfortunately as at 31 August one death of a male adult had been recorded associated with a veld fire in Mushingaidzwa Village, in Chegutu District. The incident occurred on 19 August. The now deceased was using fire to clear land for cultivation purposes and then the fire went out of control. He tried to put out the fire and it is suspected that he suffocated due to the smoke. During the same period in 2019, demise of 2 people was attributed to veld fires, thus translating to 50 percent decrease in human fatalities,” she said. Ms Sidange said children playing with fire remained one of the common causes of veld fire following an incident where a minor aged seven-years-old recently started a fire that destroyed 40 hectares of land and GMB property at Tafuna area in Shamva. She said the agency has since onset of the fire season issued eight tickets and opened three dockets against offenders. Ms Sidange said they were also working with communities to prevent spread of veld fires and reduce associated losses. “The agency is supporting communities in Hurungwe, Mbire, Muzarabani and several other fire prone areas with equipment and technical expertise on biomass reduction to prevent veld fires. Awareness programmes are still underway in the same areas to sensitise communities on veld fire prevention. All land owners and communities are reminded that it is a punishable offence to fail to put standard fire guards around land properties during the fire season. “The public is also urged not to start fires outside residential and business premises during the fire season and assist in the putting out of fires to reduce damage. Failure to comply with all these will attracts a fine or imprisonment; or both a fine and imprisonment. The veld is now dry and weather conditions are hot and windy thus very conducive for veld fires to occur. Let’s prevent veld fires and protect lives, property and the environment,” she said. Ms Sidange said a well-protected environment which is free from veld fires remained key to the nation’s agricultural productivity, tourism growth as well as the provision of ecological goods and services which support community livelihood. The fire season stretches from July 31 to October 31. Property worth $5,2 million was destroyed nationwide by veld fires and four fire related deaths were recorded during the 2019 fire season. A total of 1 158 291.57 hectares was burnt by veld fires from 1 508 incidences from July 31 to October 31, 2019, while in 2018 during the same period, a total of 1 190 174.89 hectares was burnt from 1 595 fire incidences.-@DubeMatutu
