THE Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation has approved 174 applications from Bulawayo athletes that are hoping to benefit from Government’s Covid-19 relief funds. Out of the 206 applicants, 174 have so far been approved with the ministry urging athletes to keep applying. In July, the Government, through the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation, launched a $10 million package to help athletes during the Covid-19 period. National sports associations through their provincial associations have been applying to benefit under the Covid-19 relief fund. While some provinces have already distributed the funds, too many duplications, especially in the arts sector, have caused the delay of disbursement of the funds in Bulawayo. This came to light at the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Covid-19 relief funds awareness meeting at Mhlahlandlela Government Complex yesterday. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Sports, Arts and Recreation Thokozile Chitepo called on athletes to use the funds wisely. “I would like to emphasise that the relief fund is money that should be put to good use. The relief fund must go a long way in aiding social development of athletes. The fund must improve a certain aspect of an athlete. I urge athletes to use the fund to boost their talent or skill to the next level, small as the funds may be, they must be put to good use,” said Chitepo. She also said Government was working flat out towards infrastructural development in the country. “Investment in equipment and infrastructure is something Government is working on because it improves skill. Another thing that we are seriously considering is club development from ground level all the way to the top,” she said. — @innocentskizoe
