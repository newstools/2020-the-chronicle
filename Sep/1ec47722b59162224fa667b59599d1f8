Plumtree was supposed to be reverberating with song and dance celebrating the Kalanga culture next month, but due to Covid-19 the Luswingo Kalanga Cultural Festival has been shelved. Organised by the Kalanga Language and Cultural Development Association (KLCDA), the Luswingo Kalanga Cultural Festival is held annually to promote and celebrate Kalanga language and culture through art, music and dance in addition to other activities. It is traditionally held at Luswingo Heritage Site, a former Kalanga settlement in Bulilima district, south-west of Plumtree town. Head of the publicity committee for KLCDA Divine Dube said they cancelled this years festival for safety reasons. “It is with deep regret that the Kalanga Language and Cultural Development Association (KLCDA) announces the cancellation of the 2020 edition of the Luswingo Kalanga Cultural Festival initially scheduled to take place in Tokwana, Bulilima, in October. “Given the country’s current coronavirus regulations, and with the safety of the festival attendees, musicians, volunteers, and members in mind, the festival committee has resolved to cancel this year’s event,” said Dube in a statement. This did not mean that all hope was lost as Dube said the cancellation meant they could plan for a bigger and better event next year. “While KLCDA shares the disappointment in the annulment, the association plans to use the hiatus to plan an even bigger and better festival in 2021, should the Covid-19 pandemic recede. The festival committee will keep people posted about any new developments,” said Dube. Due to the restrictions on public gatherings, many events planned for this year have been cancelled due to the pandemic around the country. In Bulawayo some events went virtual such as the Bulawayo Arts Festival with the Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo seemingly taking the same route.
