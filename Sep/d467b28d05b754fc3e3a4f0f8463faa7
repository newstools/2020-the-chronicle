Afro-fusion songstress Cinginkosi Ncube is working on her debut album which she hopes to release before the end of this year. Known as Cingi in the music circles, the 26-year-old artiste said the album will bring out who she is. “The theme of the album is ‘be very you’, a mantra I’ve always echoed at every chance I get as a woman,” said Cingi. She said the sound was Afro-fusion and proudly Zimbabwean. Cingi said the album that will have six tracks,will put women on the map. “Women are taking a stand in the music industry and it’s truly what I hope to achieve as well when I release my first album,” she said. A Local Government Studies (LGS) MSU graduate, Cingi who sings with a Victoria Falls group called Eternal Worship, said she sings inspirational songs. “I get inspiration from people’s day to day lives. The stories I tell through my music are basically about our everyday living so I’ll never run out of things to sing about,” said Cingi. Although she fuses her music with bits of house, afro-pop and afro-soul, the musician who has had stints with Joyful Praise Choir and MSU Gospel Choir, said her main genre is Afro-fusion. Cingi who has three singles, Biza Njalo, Dela and Mina, said she is inspired by singers such as Zahara, Simphiwe Dana, Ami Faku and Lira.- @mthabisi_mthire.
