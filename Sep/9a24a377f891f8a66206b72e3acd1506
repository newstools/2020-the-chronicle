SOUTH Africa-based Martin “The Big Boss” Sibanda, leader of popular Rhumba group, Ndolwane Super Sounds is set to celebrate his 49th birthday through a gig next week. The event is set to be held on October 10 at the recently refurbished Underground Hillbrow Theatre which is run by his Bulilima homeboy, promoter Phakama “PK” Nkomo. An array of artistes namely Dupute Warriors, Dubia Masters, Major Natives, Amapiano brothers, Ry Jo-ice, Asafa Kamili, Intercessor and DJ Mtharimba among others are set to aid The Big Boss have a good time on his special day. Speaking from his South Africa Base, The Big Boss through his recently appointed personal advisor, Ntombi Binali said the event is also meant to promote his fellow countrymen, artistes in the neighbouring country. “On my special day, there will be the performances from a number of artistes and the important thing about the event is to promote up and coming artistes giving them a room to show case their talents.” With rumours in the arts corridors that The Big Boss is cooking something in the oven, fans may be in for a treat of new tracks as he seems to be spicing up his career with the recent management appointments evidence of such. This comes as the music legend has starved his fans of new music as he rather takes too long to release albums. He dropped his last album Konke Sizokulungisa album in 2017 after a five-year hiatus from Bakhuzeni in 2012. Binali acknowledged that The Big Boss is working on an album but could not reveal date of the launch. “Yes, it is true The Big Boss is working on an album that we is going to be released anytime soon and it is definitely going to be a hit,” she said.- @mthabisi_mthire.
