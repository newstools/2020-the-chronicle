ZIFA president Felton Kamambo returns to the Harare Magistrates Court this morning for the start of his trial where he faces allegations that he bribed some Zifa councillors ahead of the December 2018 elections to induce them to vote for him. Philip Chiyangwa, the man Kamambo defeated to land the Zifa presidency, is the complainant in the case. Kamambo appeared before Harare magistrate Richard Ramaboa on August 25 and he was not asked to plead. The trial could not progress as the defence had not been served with all the state papers and Ramaboa adjourned the matter to today. Chenaimoyo Gumiro, the Zifa lawyer, said they have had enough time to prepare a defence since they have been furnished with all the documents related to the case. “We are now ready to go; we have had sight of the state papers, that is the charge sheet, state outline and the witness statements from the state witnesses. We have been given statements from the 32 Zifa councillors and three other witnesses,” Gumiro said. Having gone through the state papers and accounts from witnesses, Gumiro is optimistic the defence team will be able to get Kamambo off the hook. “After going through the state papers and witnesses’ statements we are confident our client has a good defence. We are keen to prove our client’s innocence come the trial date,” said Gumiro. Kamambo is alleged to have made several mobile money transfers to the 32 councillors who form part of those who elect the association’s leadership ahead of the polls where he prevailed over Chiyangwa. Some of the payments are said to have been made from Kamambo’s former chief election agent Robert Matoka’s mobile money account. Matoka is expected to take to the witness stand. Apart from Matoka and the 32 councillors, the other witnesses are Chiyangwa as well as former Zifa vice-president Omega Sibanda. — @Mdawini_29
