A SUSPECTED poacher has been arrested while two others escaped after they were found skinning six kudus they allegedly trapped using wire snares in Kasibo area outside Hwange town. The trio is suspected to be part of poaching syndicates that have been illegally hunting wild animals around Hwange. Herdboys from Kasibo Village under Chief Whange who were looking for their lost cow bumped into the three suspects skinning the kudus in the bush on Monday and tipped police. The suspects offered the boys some meat to buy their silence but the lads refused. Acting on a tip-off, police detectives and Zimparks rangers attached to the Nhaka Yedu/Ilifa Lethu Government wildlife programme, proceeded to the bush and found a base where the suspects would skin and dry the meat. There was no one at the base and police noted four wire lines with semi dried meat. The team tracked some footprints which led them to another base about 1,5km away where they found the trio cooking. The three suspects fled upon seeing police but one of them, Patrick Dube (68) of Madumabisa village was arrested. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Chief Inspector Siphiwe Makonese confirmed the arrest of Dube who is expected to appear in court facing poaching charges. Chief Insp Makonese said police and rangers recovered six kudu skulls, 24 hooves, hides, six sacks of semi dried meat, three axes, knives and rolls of wire snares from a base in the bush. â€” @ncubeleon
