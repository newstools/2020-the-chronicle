GWANDA-based reggae artiste, Bry has expressed the need for people in love to open up rather than bottling up their difficulties which later lead to a sorrowful way of living. Speaking from his Gwanda base, Bry said as an artiste he felt he has a role to play in being some sort of love doctor to his fans. He has done this through recently releasing a nine-track album titled Tears of the Sun which features talented artistes among them Ti Gonzi, Guspy Warrior and Queen. “Taking note that our generation has been filled with love relationships that do not last and there is not trust, I’ve taken upon myself the job to give them some love advice. “The album is filled with message of shunning violence, pampering your woman or man, respecting your partner, opening up about one’s love relationship among other things,” said Bry. The album was produced by a team comprised of T Man from Mount Zion Records, Lance Hebron from Janic Studios, NestyB from Chee Ghetto Studios and Marz and TFlow from Tycoon Entertainment. The tracks are Fading, Tears of the Sun, Bend Over featuring Guspy Warrior, Heart Roaster featuring Ti Gonzi, Romeo and Juliet featuring Queens, You, Hands of Time, Dosent Matter and Blessing. The album has been uploaded last Saturday on ZimReality YouTube channel and Bravesounds Entertainment. The artiste said he is sourcing funds from well-wishers on shooting visuals for the tracks. He said he is targeting to shoot the visuals in the company of his fans who will give out their real-life love relationships. “From the album, I’ve done two music videos for the songs Bend Over and Fading and I’m asking for well-wishers to assist me in shooting a lot more. “Through the videos, I’m sure the message of embracing love and opening up is well understood and can be easily implemented,” he said. – @mthabisi_mthire.
