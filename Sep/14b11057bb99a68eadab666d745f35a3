GOSPEL musician Siza Mdlongwa who proposed in style to his fiancée Thulisile Matshazi at a concert dubbed #SizaDVDLive on November 30 last year in Bulawayo, has postponed his wedding which was scheduled for today. The wedding has now been shifted to December at a date yet to be announced and to assure his fiancée that she will walk down the aisle, Mdlongwa will be launching two tracks namely Muntu Wami and Uluju Lwami from his EP called The Love Altar. Mdlongwa proposed last year at Family of God Auditorium in Bulawayo, much to the amazement of people. The tracks will be launched today on various digital platforms on the day the love birds were supposed to wed. Mdlongwa said the tracks are dedicated to his fiancée. “This will be my third project after Sabelo Sami and He’s Alive DvD that I recorded last year in November. I called it ‘The Love Altar’ and it’s comprised of two original tracks composed by myself and produced by Neshville of Rockup Studios. My love life is just sweet and we don’t sing Alpha and Omega in our bedrooms but romance is biblical so I saw it fit that I do this project. “The first track Muntu wami is a special dedication to my lovely lady, I proposed in front of thousands of people and it is meant to convince her that the right time is coming. The second track ULuju Lwami is a groovy song that has a touch of the best saxophonist Vuyile Qongo, Simba Mpofu on keys, Theo Chawaz on guitar and Hlehlelani doing magic on bass while Amanda Tapera, a praise and worship leader at Divine Love Ministries is on vocals,” said Mdlongwa. He said the EP is a project he did during the lockdown and is inspired by love in general. — @mthabisi_mthire.
