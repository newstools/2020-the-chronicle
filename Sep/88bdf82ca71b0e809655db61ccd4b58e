A new online television show, The Wave, is on the cards and is billed to showcase up and coming and seasoned musicians as they promote their work on the platform. The Wave will start airing September 21, on AJVAFRI-Art YouTube channel with over 15 episodes recorded so far. These will be showcased twice a week on the channel and they will be four minutes long to allow the artistes to showcase their new songs. So far, Novuyo Seagirl, Hwabaraty, Tebza, Mzoe 7, Mawiza and Lights Out are some of the artistes that will be showcased on the show. Jeffery Sibanda co-founder of AJVAFRI-Art said: “The show is similar to Colors Show (Germany), Tiny Desk (USA) and Show Room (Zambia) offers a minimalistic stage to shine a spotlight on the artistes and give them the opportunity to present their music to the internet audience in a unique set up.” Sibanda said artistes will be showcased at random. “We want to showcase gospel musician and non-gospel musicians during the two screenings. So, the two videos of the week will be having a list of eclectic and impeccable collection of artistes whom their live performances will be posted twice a week in no specific order. “All performances are shot in a monochromatic room (Orange) with LED lights shaping the musician’s initials and a microphone stand only,” said Sibanda.
