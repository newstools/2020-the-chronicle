YOUTHFUL entertainer Tebza says as a young artiste he has felt the urge from fans to come up with a song, that can ride on the Amapiano craze, hence he released the track President of Ama2k. The song released yesterday is one of the tracks that Tebza wants to use to remain relevant in the cut throat music industry. Born Tebogo Moyo, Tebza released the track on the AJV Afri Art’s YouTube page. Ama2k is a colloquial name for a generation of youths who were born on or after the year 2000. This is a generation of youths that are free spirited and Tebza is one of them having been born on 20 February 2005. Amapiano craze that originated and has taken over South Africa has set its roots in Zimbabwe, especially the country’s cultural capital, Bulawayo where Tebza is from. Ama2k in both countries have fallen in love with the craze with Amapiano being the tonic of most parties where they are the majority. Tebza who is a Form Three pupil at Milton High School said fans were always asking him to release a track during this lockdown. “It has been a long time since I released a song and I felt the pressure from people to do something. So, I then decided to go into the studio and give people what they want, hence this song, the President of Ama2k,” said Tebza. The Wazikhothilihlo hitmaker said the song was recorded at Kontrol Tribe studios, adding that he was not signed to the label. “I didn’t think the song was going to be loved by people so much. I just went into the studio and laid some lines on a track and things came together with Maanplaza my producer and Mduman who features in the song,” said Tebza. He said this will spur him on to release more music. “Perhaps in December I’ll release more music, something like trap or kwaito, I’m yet to decide. The music video for this song will be released on Friday on AJV Afri Art YouTube page,” said Tebza.
