The Chronicle BRUCE Grobbelaar is widely considered as one of the greatest African footballers in Premier League history for his iconic 13-year stint with Liverpool where he made 628 appearances, winning 19 major titles, including six league triumphs. After his career ended, the Durban-born goalkeeper returned to South Africa, where he managed Seven Stars, Hellenic, SuperSport United, Manning Rangers and Bush Bucks between 1999 and 2004. While he has since not managed in the Absa Premiership, the 62-year-old revealed to On The Whistle Podcast that he was poised for a sensational return with Amakhosi, but team manager Bobby Motaung opted for another candidate. “There are a lot of them (PSL clubs who contacted me), I’ve been in touch with Kaizer Motaung at Kaizer Chiefs, but I couldn’t get that one because Bobby was the one picking the coaches,” the former Zimbabwe international said. “There are a lot of them I have been in touch with (but my return is dependent) if the owners have balls. I’m talking about big cojones to get Bruce Grobbelaar back to their team.” He added: “They (PSL club bosses) know my potential as a coach. If you ever look at my history of coaching in South Africa, no team has ever gone down. “And I’m talking about places in the league. They’ve always gone up. And that’s what I strive to, to make people play better and to enjoy themselves on the park. “If you can make the players better, that’s what I’m about. “I’ll argue with the owners all day long when they do not allow the players to get the best. Then they gonna have me to go through.” — KickOff
