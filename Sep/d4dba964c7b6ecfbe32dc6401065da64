THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) has begun the process of recruiting a new top management team as it implements a restructuring exercise in line with Government’s directive. Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister, Joe Biggie Matiza, recently ordered the NRZ board, which is chaired by Advocate Martin Dinha, to trim the number of executive directors from six to three. The initiative has seen senior managers being retired as part of the restructuring exercise meant to bring in fresh blood to turnaround Zimbabwe’s strategic bulk transporter. The general manager, Engineer Lewis Mukwada, director marketing, Mrs Elector Mafunga, director corporate services, Mr Misheck Matanhire and director operations, Mr Samson Bhuza have been sent on early retirement. Mr Joseph Mashika has been appointed acting general manager. The parastatal over the weekend flighted a vacancy notice seeking to recruit general manager, company secretary (corporate services division), chief internal auditor, chief finance officer and chief operations officer. NRZ public relations manager, Mr Nyasha Maravanyika who is serving his retirement notice, said the advertised positions were part of the restructuring exercise. “The advertisements that NRZ placed over the weekend with regards to job vacancies are part of the restructuring process,” he said. Mr Maravanyika said as directed NRZ under the new structure will have only three directors instead of six as was the case before. – @okazunga.
