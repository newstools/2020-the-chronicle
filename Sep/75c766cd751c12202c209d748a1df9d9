THE Zanu-PF Midlands executive will soon meet to deliberate on applications made by two former ministers who have applied to be readmitted into the ruling party following their sacking. Former Minister of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture, Makhosini Hlongwane and former Deputy Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Tapiwanashe Matangaidze are part of many Zanu-PF members who were expelled after they were found guilty of misconduct in 2018. In an interview, Zanu-PF Midlands provincial chairperson Engineer Daniel Mackenzie Ncube confirmed that the pair were among those who made applications to be readmitted into the party. “We have applications from expelled members who include former ministers. We have got applications from Makhosini Hlongwane and Tapiwa Matangaidze. We will be sitting down to make our decision. “It’s something we should have done about two weeks ago, so we are trying to get a slot so that we deliberate on the issue and make the necessary recommendation to the party headquarters. We are far behind on the issue,” said Engineer McKenzie Ncube. The Midlands provincial chairperson said Zanu-PF is a “big tent”, and that people who want to join or re-join the party were most welcome after being vetted. “In the event the applicants are re-admitted, they will start fom bottom rank and they will be observed over time to ensure that they are now compliant in everything they do,” said Engineer Mackenzie Ncube. Last year, Zanu-PF readmitted its former secretary for Administration Cde Didymus Mutasa and retired Brigadier-General Ambrose Mutinhiri.
