OLD Mutual’s banking subsidiary, CABS, has re-opened its branches across the country after their closure following a recent Covid-19 scare. The deadly pandemic was first detected in China last December and has plagued the rest of the world claiming close to one million people globally. In Zimbabwe, the disease was detected in March and over 6 000 people have been infected so far with death toll of just over 200. In a statement, CABS managing director Mr Mehluli Mpofu said a few of their banking halls were closed with a majority remaining operational. He said they encouraged their clients to use digital channels to reduce the risk of exposure and spread of the disease. “We wish to advise that Arundel, Avondale, Borrowdale, Chitungwiza, Kwekwe and Mutare branches have been re-opened. “The branches had been temporarily closed to allow for disinfection of the branches, routine PCR testing and self-isolation of our staff members,” he said. In Harare, the branches that remained open are Harare Central Avenue, Greenzone Old Mutual Gardens, Chisipite Kelvin Corner, First Street, Northridge Park, and Greenzone CBD Westgate. Other cities and towns that were affected include Bulawayo, Northridge Park, Bindura, Kadoma, Chinhoyi, Kariba, Chipinge, Karoi, Chiredzi, Marondera, Gokwe, Masvingo, Gwanda, Murehwa, Gweru, Victoria Falls, Hauna, Zvishavane, Hwange and Murambinda. “We urge you to continue using our digital channels; internet and mobile banking platforms to reduce the risk of exposure and spread of Covid-19 during this period. “We encourage you to remain vigilant and adhere to the precautionary measures that have been put in place for your safety,” said Mr Mpofu. He said his organisation will continue to monitor the situation and implement changes where necessary for the safety of all their stakeholders. — @okazunga
