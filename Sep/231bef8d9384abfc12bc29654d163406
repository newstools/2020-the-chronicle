The Chronicle Joel Tsvakwi, Showbiz Correspondent Songstress Nomah T (real name Nomalanga Tshuma), a survivor of gender-based violence (GBV) has composed an Amapiano single which she wants to use to help fight the abuse through the song’s message. Titled Ngenzeni?, the single which is due to be released soon sees the musician condemning the barbaric behaviour by abusers. Nomah T said she used the popular Amapiano sound to make the song appealing adding that it has a banging beat and melodies that are accompanied by well-executed vocals. “I used the Amapiano sound because it’s currently the most popular and trending genre and I hope that’ll help my message reach far and wide,” said Nomah T. The song is coupled with a heartbreaking plea to abusers where Nomah T asks: “. . . what did I do wrong for you to beat me up every day?” hence thesong’s tittle Ngenzeni?. What makes the song carry more weight and stand apart from others is the fact that it was composed by a person who survived GBV. Because of what she encountered, she said it took a lot of guts and bravery to sing about this sensitive issue. “Having experienced domestic violence myself, I have subjective feelings for it, hence my decision to use music to condemn it,” the musician explained. The musician who worked with award-winning Sandra Ndebele previously said it is important for artistes to tell women’s stories through music. “Majority of women are suffering in silence. It hurts to see how women are resorting to alcohol, drugs and extra marital affairs to numb the pain endured in the hands of their spouses.” She said she is now working round the clock to produce the video for the single. Other than the forthcoming GBV track, Nomah T released another Amapiano track that features Mfana Teezy and a gospel album titled Your Grace that was released in 2018. Last year, she released five house singles.
