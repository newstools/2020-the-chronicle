Due to his intimate attachment to his hometown, he has performed at various local events such as the Gweru Summer Splash in 2014 which was organised by Chipaz Promotions. He also performed at shows in South Africa. In 2014, he composed a song for the city of Gweru after it turned 100 years. – @mthabisi_mthire.
