Local Government and Public Works Minister, Cde July Moyo has since written to Beitbridge town clerk, Mr Loud Ramakgapola informing him of the latest development.

However, both the outgoing mayor, Cllr Ncube and Cllr Nyoni confirmed the development. “What you have heard is true. What has happened gives me time to serve people in a different capacity and I wish well all those who remained at council. I encourage them to carry on with our vision of improving service delivery in our town for the next three years. The people should be the winners,” said the outgoing Mayor.
