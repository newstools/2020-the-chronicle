Afropop/Soul singer MJ Sings will hold a live performance this weekend after his fans asked him to hold one. The show dubbed A Night with MJ Sings will be streamed live via Asakhane Live Facebook page on September 18 at 7PM (CAT). MJ Sings (real name Mncedisi Jeremiah Ncube) whose soulful voice is behind tracks such as Ngizobuya, Phakade and Dali Wami said since the Covid-19 induced lockdown fans have been pressing him to do a live show. “A night with MJ Sings will be the first 2020 live performance by me. That was inspired by the fans constant inquiry about witnessing me live on stage. I’ll be delivering live some of your favourite hits that you have come to love him for with a live band,” said MJ Sings. He said the demand for his performance has shown him that people really miss his music. “It’s an alert that there’s demand for the product but I always try and focus on the timing and impact more than flooding people with live content. So, on this one I took some time to properly work on the story line, mood, theme and having full control of the creation of the show,” said MJ Sings. MJ Sings in 2012 came second during Bulawayo’s Got Talent music search and made it to the finals of Dreamstar in 2015. He was part of a boy band named Oasis Band as a lead singer. MJ Sings travelled to South Africa in 2016 to look for the proverbial greener pastures, but things did not pan out like he had hoped. He decided to return home two years ago.
