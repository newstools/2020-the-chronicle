Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS) officer Taremeredzwa Kwangwari, a talented Zimdancehall chanter popularly known as Tare True Defender has dropped his first video. The video for his song titled Mai Nyasha is a true reflection of his life and in the song he urges people never to lose hope. The video was released last Sunday and Tare said he is working on establishing his Tare True Defender brand. The video which was shot and directed by Bulawayo-based Tinashe Gijima of Brooklyn Films International, has attracted the attention of the corporate world and some prominent figures in the entertainment industry who took to social media hailing the video. Award-winning Mandla da Comedian said: “I’ve fallen in love with the life being portrayed. It’s real and this shows we’re going somewhere. Bulawayo has been always the hub of the creative industry and only the sky is the limit.” Motivational speaker and author, Marshal Chiza said: “It was love at first sight. The video is just superb and its realism captured me. If my guess is correct, I became the first to comment on the video on Tare True Defender’s Facebook page.” The song was recorded sometime back by producer Levels at Chillspot Records in Harare. Tare True Defender who is also riding high on the success of another single, Mwana Wekumahosteri, said he is raring to go. He said he is in talks with the ZBCtv crew to have his latest video shown by the national broadcaster. “We are making efforts to ensure that the video is shown on ZBC so that our small screen fans have a feel of it. I’m also working on the release of my 2020 singles. “More music is definitely coming as we’re almost done with the singles that we’ll be launching soon,” said Tare.” – @joelTsvakwi
