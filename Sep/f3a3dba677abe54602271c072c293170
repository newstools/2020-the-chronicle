HIGHLANDERS have set their sights on growing the club’s brand and utilising its value following success of the crowdfunding initiative led by fans that resulted in the club clearing its legacy debt. Club chairman Kenneth Mhlophe said Bosso is a broad sporting tree shade for all regardless of background. “Further to the successful project-specific crowdfunding initiative targeting the legacy debt, which weighed heavily on the club for years, our immediate objective becomes that of strengthening the brand for current and future utilisation of its value,” Mhlophe said. He said regular fan and stakeholder engagement at various levels through different platforms was key to attaining their goals. “We acknowledge the broad sporting tree shade the club has become, and the beauty the shade provides for all who seek its shelter. “In line with the club’s constitution, which recognises all of the club’s communities as equal regardless of the plethora of socio-economic and political realities of individuals, the club will be rolling out projects and activities designed to fulfil its mandate. “We are of the perspective that the club’s new trajectory, which focuses on commercial and sporting success, depends on us creating a conducive environment for all our current and future fans, partners and sponsors regardless of their class, gender, race or creed,” he said. — @innocentskizoe
