HIGHLANDERS scored a hat-trick after all their three senior team coaches Bekithemba Ndlovu, Mandla Mpofu and Melusi Sibanda got national team appointments in a development that sees 10 Bulawayo-based coaches being given national assignments. Bosso 90 coach Sibanda will be assistant in the Under-15 technical team headed by legendary former Zimbabwe Saints and national team hitman Agent Sawu, while Mpofu will assist Tonderayi Ndiraya in the Under-23 squad and Ndlovu will deputise Philani Ncube in the Under-20 national side. <img class="wp-image-458369 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Bekithemba-“Super”-Ndlovu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Bekithemba-“Super”-Ndlovu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Bekithemba-“Super”-Ndlovu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bekithemba “Super” Ndlovu Zifa announced coaches for all representative men’s and women’s national teams, with Croatian Zdravko Logarušic heading the senior men’s national team. Sithethelelwe Sibanda kept her Mighty Warriors’ job and will be assisted by Under-20 head coach Rosemary Mugadza, with Highlanders’ legend Peter Nkomo coming in as goalkeepers’ coach. Other Bulawayo-based coaches that received national assignments include Bulawayo Chiefs gaffer Thulani Sibanda (Women’s Under-17 head coach) as well as Nomsa Moyo, who will assist Mugadza in the Under-20 women’s side. Zifa executive committee member and chairman of the Technical Development Committee Bryton Malandule said his committee will host an orientation meeting for all national teams’ coaches before the end of the year. “We have finalised the list of coaches for all our representative national teams. Maybe for the avoidance of any doubt, I will name coaches that were recommended by the technical and development committee and subsequently approved by the Zifa executive committee. As you are aware, for the senior team our head coach is Logarušic, assisted by Lloyd Chitembwe and Ndiraya. The goalkeepers’ coach is South Africa-based Pernell McKop, with Tembo Chuma on standby in the event that McKop will not be available,” said Malandule. <img class="wp-image-456959 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/melusi-Sibanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/melusi-Sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/melusi-Sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Melusi Sibanda Former Chapungu goalie Innocent Chogugudza is the Under-23 goalkeepers’ coach. “To ensure that we have continuity in our national teams, the Under-23 coach automatically comes into the senior team as an assistant. Even in the Under-23 squad, we have our Under-20 coach as an assistant. Our Under-17 coach Tafadzwa Mashiri will be one of the Under-20 assistant coaches,” Malandule said. He said Mike Madzivanyika and Sawu will be Mashiri’s assistants in the Under-17s. Hope Bera will be in charge of the Under-15 goalkeeping department in which James Mohala is one of the assistant coaches. “For the women’s side, Sithethelelwe Sibanda will be assisted by Perkins Nyamutamba and Mugadza for continuity, while Nkomo is the goalkeepers’ coach. In the Under-20 set-up, Mugadza will be assisted by Nomsa Moyo and Under-17 coach Thulani Sibanda, with Ndega Matsika being the goalkeepers coach. Hwange High School and Mosi oa Tunya High School teachers Evelyn Rimai and Irene Mwanza will be assistant coaches to Sibanda in the Under-17 women’s national team where Alice Ruzani has been tasked with working with the goalkeepers,” Malandule said. In line with Fifa’s thrust to develop football right down to the young age groups and in view of pending the Cosafa Under-15 tournament, Zifa has set-up a coaching structure that will be headed by Rimai, assisted by Dorothy Nyakonda, Boga Ndebele and Peter Masibhera, who is the goalkeepers’ coach.
