Michael Gambiza (30) from Filabusi and Nkosinamandla Ncube (20) from Mberengwa were not asked to plead when they appeared before Gwanda magistrate, Ms Lerato Nyathi facing a robbery charge. They were remanded in custody to September 21. Prosecuting, Miss Glenda Nare said Gambiza and Ncube and two others attacked two workers at Marble Mine in Gwanda on July 1 in the early hours of the morning armed with knobkerries, axes and catapults. “They forced open a closed door of a steel cabin where they found Mr Dean Nkala and Mr Mpilo Ndlovu and they ordered them to lie down. “They demanded valuables from the workers and they took cell phones, clothing and some electrical gadgets.
