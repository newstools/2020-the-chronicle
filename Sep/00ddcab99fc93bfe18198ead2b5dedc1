Because of Covid-19, we’ve had to pivot our programming and this has challenged us to come up with a brand new virtual programme of cutting edge curated events, brand new musical collaborations, daring comedy game shows and an inspiring digital conference too,” said Comrade Fatso. Shoko Festival production manager, Tongai Makawa aka Outspoken said the event’s line-up will be a diffusion of art genres. “We’re proud that even in these trying times, Shoko Festival is able to be one of the few cultural platforms where up-and-coming and talented poets can perform alongside the biggest acts in the country. Also, the fact that the same festival can host some of the best comedians and rappers while also running a cutting edge week-long conference that engages our political leaders on critical issues, is amazing,” said Makawa. Over the years, the festival which is one of the longest-running urban culture festivals, has provided a platform for young Zimbabwean rappers, comedians, musicians and spoken word artists to perform, collaborate and express themselves. The festival also curates cutting edge collaborations between local and international acts and builds international tours for young Zimbabwean artistes. — @mthabisi_mthire.
