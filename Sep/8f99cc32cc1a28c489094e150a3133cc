THE Victoria Falls junior council has implored the municipality to set aside a budget to finance developmental activities by junior councillors. Speaking during a 2021 budget consultation meeting organised for youths, women and special interest groups early this week, junior council members said their activities were neglected. Junior council public relations officer Nomathemba Mhlanga, a Form Four pupil at Dadani Technical College said sometimes they use their personal funds on some of the projects. “The council is not taking us seriously. We wonder what our purpose is because since we were inaugurated no-one has cared to listen. We have some projects which we should accomplish during our term but we are expected to fund ourselves yet we are not doing this for ourselves but for the constituencies they inaugurated us to represent. “We started a ‘Vaseline’ making project using candle wax and another for making sanitary pads and both need equipment and materials. We have been sourcing donations yet the council must make sure we are fully funded. We went to donate books and clothes in Matetsi using our own funds and some members have been demoralised and left, only nine are left from a total of 20,” said Nomathemba. Junior Mayor Tafadzwa Matsa, an A Level pupil at Mosi-oa-Tunya High School said the junior council has never received any help from the council since assuming office in 2018. He said their projects included an exchange visit to Namibia after a similar gesture by their Namibian counterparts last year. Junior MP, Ashely Ncube who is also Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Junior Minister said the problem was common in most councils in the province. “These concerns are common in almost all councils in the province. We have to work on it because if we don’t address the problem now it will affect the next council and Parliament,” he said in a follow up interview.-@ncubeleon
