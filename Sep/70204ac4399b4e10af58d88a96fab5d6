UHANGELWA, a television soapie mostly in Venda, premièred on national broadcaster ZBCtv on Friday, making its debut on the small screen. The hour-long soapie which has 14 episodes will show from Mondays to Fridays from 5pm. Its repeats will be shown at 11am on weekdays. As the word Uhangwela means forgiveness, the soapie chronicles events of people who are unable to forgive yet they want to be forgiven. It portrays people who find themselves at crossroads without a clear choice of whether to let go or seek revenge. While it is largely in Venda, the soapie which was shot in the border town of Beitbridge has some bits of Shona, Ndebele, Sotho and English. Speaking after the première on Friday night, producer Emmanuel Ncube said: “I’m glad the show is already getting positive feedback from people who’re appreciating our work with some showing interest in working with us. “Even on our YouTube page where we released one episode, people have been commenting saying they are impressed by the production’s quality and storyline.” With the script for Season Two already complete, Ncube said they are planning on shooting anytime soon. He called on sponsors to jump on board and support the local film industry. With a 65-member cast, whose ages range from 18 to 65 years, including Goodman Mbedzi who plays Loshani Tshinoni, Josephine Janero as Nelly Kambezo, Lordhelp Moyo as Joshua Panganai Shava and Rumbidzai Rivombo as Ndanduleni Mulaudzi, Uhangelwa is set to be a gamechanger on the national broadcaster. – @mthabisi_mthire.
