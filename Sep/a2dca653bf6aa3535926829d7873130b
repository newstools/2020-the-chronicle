Beitbridge-based videographer Master G Sky of Dr Beit Film Factory has his eyes set on penetrating the regional market by producing a music video for a Zambian artiste. Master G Sky (real name Honesty Mpofu) recently shot a video for Zambian musician Taffy Turner which will be launched on October 10. The video is set to be aired on the national television broadcaster ZBCtv, Honey Money by Dr Beit Film Factory YouTube page, Honey Money and Zim Celeb Instagram pages. The power of social media is what the artiste says gave him the regional connection. The video is now under final editing production and is expected to land on the small screens soon. Speaking from his base, Master G Sky said: “To grow my brand, I just finished working with a Zambian artiste Taffy Turner and the video was shot during the lockdown in South African and also has got Beitbridge clips as a way of marketing where the roots of my brand are. “The track we worked on is Musiye Ayende and talks about need for people not to hold on to relationships which do not suffice to anything good.” Having ventured into the videography field in 2010, Master G Sky has managed to do visuals for renowned artistes such as Stunner on Ndini Ndovanakidza, South African Delayn on Babe I Know and Beitbridge artiste, Bhadilah on Nkonela whose visuals landed on Channel O. He is also working on collaborating with the likes of Makhadzi from South Africa, Anisha from Jamaica and Mark2 from Zambia. -@mthabisi_mthire.
