The Chronicle Yoliswa Dube-Moyo I DON’T consider myself conservative, but there’s some minute fibre in me that cringes at semi-nudity. I’m not really the kind of person you’ll find wearing a pair of bum shorts with a string top. You won’t find me in a skimpy, body hugging dress either. I certainly won’t wear a pair of joggers or a short dress with heels and still show some cleavage! No, I can’t. I don’t know, it just seems like doing a little too much for me. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I wouldn’t be caught dead posing for pictures in any of the above, let alone share the images on social media! That’s just me, and we’re different, I know. But I think it must be universal that we show skin tastefully. There’s really a thin line between looking sexy and looking trashy, especially on images in the public domain or for professional purposes. About a week ago, ZiFM Stereo presenter Samantha “Misred” Mussa had all sorts of catcalls thrown at her after posting a picture of herself in bed showing a bit of cleavage. The picture was captioned “Ndanzi naShewe I love your #bedroomtools ne cellulite yese ipapo. Good night”. She “Tweets what she likes” I suppose, but people had no kind words to say to her after that post. Many dished out all sorts of insults attacking her persona, which I think was uncalled for. But, it got me thinking how often times we underestimate the importance of perception especially in professional spaces. You really don’t want to be making inappropriate insinuations with the way you dress if you can avoid it. It’s not good for your professional portfolio. If you can separate the image you put out there for people in your work circles and what’s reserved for your better half in private, then do that. Unless you’re a lingerie model, I really don’t see why you should be on social media showing off your “bedroom tools” or submitting pictures with glaring cleavages on your resumes and business portfolios. I know a lot of people think modesty is boring and unflattering, but that’s not true. I believe in showing skin tastefully. That way, you look classy and chic, not trashy or like you’re trying too hard to attract attention. <img class="alignnone wp-image-510218 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/fully-dressed-woman.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/fully-dressed-woman.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/fully-dressed-woman-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Some style choices can pass on the wrong message especially when you fail to consider the occasion when picking out outfits. Some outfits, when put on at the wrong occasion and in the wrong proportions can pass on an over-sexualised message. When wearing revealing pieces, the line between classy and inappropriate can be crossed if you’re not keen. To help balance things out, show one part at a time. This is probably one of the main rules of showing skin. To create poise, opt to reveal one part of the body at a time; that is either the legs, arms, midriff, back or low neckline. For instance, having your cleavage and midriff out, while acceptable say at the beach, is a bit much on a day to day basis. When you have too much on show, you might get unwanted attention, of the bad kind. So, if you’re wearing a short skirt or dress, ensure your cleavage and arms are covered to create some balance. Buy clothes that are the right size and flattering for your body type to prevent you from showing skin that you didn’t intend to. You’ll look put together and feel more confident. Mystery can be sexy. You’d be surprised by how much good attention you can get when you’re showing less skin. It’s always good to leave some things to imagination. For example, choose a maxi dress with a long slit or one without sleeves. You will be covered but with a hint of skin on show. Even though you might be conservative in terms of your style choices, these small details will not only push you out of your comfort zone, but make a statement. Always work with your best features. We all have parts of our bodies that we’re proud of so why not show them off? This can be a powerful way to bring back your confidence and push boundaries. When considering how to show off skin tastefully, focus on your body and not the near perfect bodies that we see on social media. Instead, take advantage of your own strengths. If you like your legs, choose shorter hemlines. If you have toned arms, opt for sleeveless tops. This is a way of appreciating yourself even when you don’t have someone else’s exact features. And your confidence will show, garnering you many compliments. How you show skin should be a sign of empowerment. You want your personality to come through, to pass on the right message and ensure that people respect you. When getting dressed, keep in mind the occasion. It’s always better to play it safe. Alternatively, use social media to get ideas on what to where, when.
