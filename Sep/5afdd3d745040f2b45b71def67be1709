The Chronicle Chi Mhende is a woman of many talents and we are proud of her latest hustle. The TV star who won the hearts of many with her role on Generations The Legacy as Wandile Radebe, whom later Mzansi discovered that she was a woman in real life, has bagged another gig on the show. The actress intrigued many with her amazing and captivating portrayal of the male character. Chi has cut her teeth in numerous Arts avenue since she shot fame, and she has now added “Trainee Director”to her impeccable resume. According to Entertainment Commentator Phil Mphela, the starlet debuted her directorial training on last night’s episode of the hit soapie. The actress has joined a number of Mzansi’s females who have decided to pursue an interest behind the scenes. It is no secret that the acting industry is known to be quite unstable and unpredictable. Jobs are usually few and far between, whereby creative practitioners are often compelled to diversify their talents and keep the gates of income streams open! As much as behind the scenes work can be very challenging for women, but a batch of Mzansi’s talented women have proven that nothing is impossible and they are killing it behind the scenes. Reacting to Phil’s post Chi expressed her gratitude and tweeted, “Thank you sire.”-Zalebs.
