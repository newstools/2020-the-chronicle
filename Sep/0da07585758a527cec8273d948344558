The Midlands Province has so far received $58 million in devolution funds from Government and invested the bulk of the money into water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) projects as well as constructing and upgrading health facilities. The projects being implemented include water reticulation at Gweru City Council, Redcliff Municipality, Runde Rural District Council and Zvishavane Town Council. Rehabilitation is being undertaken at health facilities that include Bell Medical Centre in Redcliff, Garandichauya Infectious Disease Clinic in Kwekwe, Mapfungautsi Clinic in Gokwe Town and Sesame Promise Medical Centre in Gokwe South. Midlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Larry Mavima said devolution funding is bringing significant developmental changes across the province. He expressed satisfaction on how devolution funds have been handled in the province. “The Midlands Province has so far received $58 million Devolution Funds from Central Government, and invested the bulk of the money into water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) projects and construction and upgrading of health facilities. It is, therefore, imperative that disbursements of the funds be sustained throughout the year and covering all local authorities,” he said. Minister Mavima said despite the challenging economic environment, all local authorities in the province were trying their best to provide various services to communities such water, sewer reticulation, road maintenance, among others, in their areas of jurisdiction. “Water reticulation projects are taking place in Gweru, Redcliff, Runde and Zvishavane. Rehabilitation of health facilities include Bell Medical Centre in Redcliff, Garandichauya Infectious Disease Clinic in Kwekwe, Mapfungautsi Clinic in Gokwe Town and Sesame Promise Medical Centre in Gokwe South,” he said.
