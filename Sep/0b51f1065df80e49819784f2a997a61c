The Chronicle Business Reporter LOW-COST airline, Fastjet Zimbabwe, has jumped into action following the Government’s decision to re-open the skies to allow domestic and international travel. After five months of no activity, the airline said Wednesday that it was delighted by the latest official announcement to resume domestic and international air transportation. Government on Tuesday lifted the ban on domestic and international travel after the country’s aviation sector came up with Covid-19 prevention measures. The travel approval comes with strict adherence to prescribed travel safety conditions. “Today (Wednesday), we initiated robust discussions and are actively engaged with key stakeholders as we finalise plans for the recommencement of domestic flights between Harare and Bulawayo and Harare and Victoria Falls, following yesterday’s announcement by the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting,” said Fastjet.
