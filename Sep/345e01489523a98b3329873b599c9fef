The Chronicle JOHANNESBURG – It is common for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to be reinfected, according to Vaccinologist, Professor Shabir Madhi. Madhi says this is nothing to worry about as people generally develop enough immunity to only present mild symptoms or be completely asymptomatic. “It is common for people to be reinfected, multiple times. The important thing is that after your first infection, you develop a good amount of immunity and even though you become re-exposed or reinfected, subsequent infections almost invariably going to be milder,” said Madhi. Madhi says it is important for people to continue adhering to the regulations.
