At Ncema there are also treatment works and the clear water treated there is pumped to Fernhill booster station then to the Tuli reservoirs for distribution to various residential areas in the city. Raw water is also pumped from Ncema to Fernhill then to the Criterion Water Works for treatment before distribution to the city’s reservoirs. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-509693" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/IMG-20200901-WA0065-680x453.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/IMG-20200901-WA0065-680x453.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/IMG-20200901-WA0065-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/IMG-20200901-WA0065-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/IMG-20200901-WA0065.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This is the second time that the city experiences total water cuts after BCC on Saturday, that it was going to suspend the provision of tap water until further notice in all suburbs except the central business district, mines and industry. The water was temporarily restored on Monday evening in some of the city’s suburbs. In a statement yesterday, Bulawayo Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube said the surge resulted in the shutdown of the system. “The City of Bulawayo would like to advise the public of water supply interruptions to all the areas across the City with effect from Tuesday the 1st of September 2020 due to a power surge at Fernhill Booster Station that has affected clear water and raw water delivery to Tuli Reservoir and Criterion Water Works respectively,” said Mr Dube. “This affects the whole City’s Water Supply System until the problem in resolved. Consumers are further advised that water supply to both Eastern and Western areas will be closed and shall be available when reservoir levels per each reservoir zone allow after the rectification of the above-mentioned development.”
