Tobacco is the one of the major foreign currency earners in Zimbabwe and has over the years contributed substantially to providing liquidity support in the economy. Zimbabwe exports its flue-cured tobacco around the world to countries such as China, Belgium, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, India, United States of America, South Africa, Malawi, Egypt, Zambia Mozambique and Kenya, among others.
Last year, the country earned about US$1 billion from tobacco exports. Meanwhile, the Government has urged farmers not to allow their attention to be diverted from preparing their land for the forthcoming season by the lies being peddled that they will lose their land to white former commercial farmers under the Global Compensation Deed, which covers improvements only and carefully excludes land. @okazunga
