MANICA Diamonds attacking midfielder Last Jesi (25), who was on loan at champions FC Platinum, has signed a three-year deal with Sudanese giants Al Hilal after agreeing personal terms with the club. The dreadlocked midfielder becomes the second player after former Dynamos winger Edward Sadomba to play for Al Hilal. Sadomba became a cult hero at the Sudanese side where he played for some years and Jesi will be hoping to establish himself as a key figure at the club. Manica Diamonds broke news of Jesi’s deal on their official Twitter account. “Manica Diamonds FC have reached an agreement with Al Hilal for the transfer of midfielder Last Jesi. Jesi, who has been on loan at @FCPlatinum, joins the Sudanese giants on a 3-year deal. Thanks for the memories Lala,” tweeted Manica Diamonds. According to reports, Al Hilal and Manica Diamonds agreed on a US$80 000 transfer fee for Jesi. Jesi joined the FC Platinum on a year-long loan deal alongside striker Stanley Ngala from Manica Diamonds at the beginning of the year. The pair featured for FC Platinum in the Caf Champions League group stages, with Jesi reportedly impressing Al Hilal in a match played in Khartoum, Sudan where the platinum miners lost 1-0 in January. Al Hilal officials inquired about the player before the end of that match, indicating that they wanted to organise a trial stint for Jesi. Jesi had made an impressive debut for FC Platinum in January in a 1-1 draw against Egyptian giants Al Ahly before that game against Al Hilal. — @ZililoR
