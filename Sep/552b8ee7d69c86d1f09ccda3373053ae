CRICKETERS who play in the domestic league and are not members of the national team will start training once Government gives Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) the greenlight to play games. Only national team players have been training in Harare and Bulawayo in preparation for the proposed tour of Pakistan. Following cancellation of the proposed incoming tour by Afghanistan due to additional measures put in place by the Government to curb spread of Covid-19, ZC sought to salvage their international year with a trip to Pakistan. ZC spokesperson Darlington Majonga said they are waiting for the Government through the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to respond to their request to travel to Pakistan as well as start local leagues for both men and women. ZC is hopeful that the Pakistan series and start of the domestic action will go ahead since Government had given low risk sports permission to return to action. “We wrote to Government through SRC requesting for clearance to travel to Pakistan as well as start our domestic season. “Right now as you are aware it’s only the national team pool that is training and the rest of the cricketers will start once we have been cleared for the domestic league. “We are planning to launch the National Premier League for men and provincial competitions for women. A lot is lined up and we’ve outlined plans for safe return of sport,” said Majonga. It hasn’t been a good period for ZC, which had a bright start of the year, beginning with a home Test series against Sri Lanka, which was followed by a full tour of Bangladesh.
Other scheduled tours were postponed following outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. — @ZililoR
