ALTERNATIVE musician Hwabaraty continues to collaborate with artistes with his latest one being the song Jola this time taking the Zimbabwe Rhumba music route roping in one of its exponents Clement Magwaza. The track will be released this Saturday on all digital platforms and radio stations. The Njube born Hwabaraty has been doing collaborations this past year with the penultimate one being Umsindo that features Zimbabwe hip hop star Asaph. According to the artiste, the collaboration with Magwaza is one of the ways in which he wants to show how versatile he is as an artiste. “With collaborations as a musician you learn a lot. You learn a lot of elements that you wouldn’t have known. So, I want to broaden my horizons as an artiste and to stretch myself as a musician as I have done, Amapiano, hip hop and kwaito, now Rhumba,” said Hwabaraty. He said it was a pleasure working with Magwaza. <img class="wp-image-511652 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Magwaza.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Magwaza.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Magwaza-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Magwaza “It was an honour working with Magwaza, a guru in that genre. We blended well in the song and we didn’t have any problems coming up with the track. I promise people that this is one to look out for, something that they haven’t seen before,” said Hwabaraty. Explaining the song, Hwabaraty said Jola was a warning to would be adulterers in society. “The song’s message is about someone (be it a man or woman), who are delinquents and don’t want to listen to their parents or someone who is trying to correct them. Whether it’s a woman who commits adultery or a man, the song tells them that their actions will come back and bite them,” said Hwabaraty. Asked about his album, Hwabaraty said he was working hard at it and would announce it. “All the singles that I have released this year won’t be on the album. Rather the album will be an extension of me, the real Hwabaraty, what I stand for, what I want to do as an artiste. I have a sound that people will get to know when I release the album, when that will be people will have to be patient,” said Hwabaraty.
