VOCALIST PJ Flames who made a name for himself in Bulawayo singing for popular Band Fusion is on the mend after going under the knife in the United Kingdom recently to get his appendix removed. PJ Flames (real name Petros Nyambi) was the lead singer of PJay and Flame Band (later Band Fusion), that played at different nightspots in the city such as The Place, Safari Bar and the now defunct Club Connect and Cape to Cairo. Two weeks ago, PJ Flames was singing for people via Facebook live and had no idea he would go under the knife days later. Updating fans on the operation on his Facebook fan page, he shared two images of himself seemingly in pain. “The last 48 hours have been a terrible time following an appendectomy surgery. Thank you family and friends, I’m a lot better now and have been discharged from the hospital. “Thank you for your prayers and support. It’s good to be home,” he posted. In a follow-up interview, PJ Flames said all was well until last Sunday night when his health turned for the worse. “I was okay all along and then on Sunday night, the pain started. I went to work and when I came back on Monday morning, the pain got worse. I went to hospital and was admitted and had an appendectomy on Tuesday night,” he said. PJ Flames who relocated to the UK last year to be with his wife Bridgette said he is recovering well and thanked everyone who has been wishing him a speedy recovery. “I came this side in September last year. In January last year, I got married to Bridgette in Zimbabwe and we decided to stay together in the UK where she’s based. It’s not good for married people to live apart hence I made this decision,” he said.
