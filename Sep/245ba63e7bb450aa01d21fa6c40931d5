Do you miss attending weddings this season due to the Covid-19 pandemic? Worry not, United Kingdom-based artiste Sisa Senkosi has you covered as she has captured the wedding vibe on her Ngiyavuma I Do musical video. The visuals of the song which features Platform One and Moses Ngwenya were released last week and made people reminisce about weddings, also giving hope to those who could not wed as planned due to the pandemic. The video was shot during Ntando and Buhlebenkosi Ncube’s wedding in December last year at various locations in Ntabazinduna and Bulawayo. The visuals feature among others Nani Ntengo and Sonto Dhladla of Platform One. Videographer Tswarelo Mothobi shot the video which has costumes portraying the rich African culture. The outfits were designed by South Africa-based Sharon Ntuta from Makokoba and Sakhile Tracy Ndlovu. Speaking from UK, Sisa Senkosi said: “The video portrays the feel-good factor that we all get at a wedding, the food, the bride’s dress, family fun and happiness.” Commenting on the video, most hailed Sisa Senkosi for the song and visuals. Since the song’s release last year, it has been roaring at the few wedding ceremonies that have been held in Zimbabwe and South Africa as well as UK and Canada. The song was produced by Vusa Mkhaya. — @mthabisi_mthire.
