The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent AUSTRALIA-based gospel music sensation, Samantha Simangaliso, has released her second single titled Higher Ground, following the release of Follow Jesus earlier this year. Commenting on the latest release, Simangaliso said: “The song is a prayer seeking direction from God to be led in His ways.” Listening to the track, one is met with a mid-tempo offering that is nothing short of the robust musicality associated with the Israel Sebenzo Media & Entertainment Group. Higher Ground is available on iTunes and is expected to be uploaded on YouTube on Friday afternoon. – @mthabisi_mthire
