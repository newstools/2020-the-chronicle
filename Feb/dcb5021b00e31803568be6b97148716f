The Chronicle Michell Zvanyanya, Chronicle Reporter POLICE in Bulawayo have arrested two men after they were found in illegal possession of 50 metres of copper cables and a python skin. Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said Simon Jele of Umguza District and Ndabezinhle Ndlovu of Trenance suburb were arrested on Saturday following a tip off from members of the public. “I can confirm the arrest of two suspects for illegal possession of 50 metres of copper cables whose value is yet to be ascertained and a python skin. Sauerstown police conducted the arrest. Both the copper cables and the python skin were recovered,” he said. Insp Ncube said the police first received a tip off from members of the public that Jele was in possession of the copper cables and a python skin at his house in Umguza District. He said following the tip off, Sauerstown police conducted a raid at Jele’s house which led to the recovery of copper cables and a python skin. “The police further interviewed Jele who then implicated Nkomo of Fletcher Road in Trenance suburb as his accomplice. The two were arrested and will appear in court soon,” said Insp Ncube. He expressed concern over continuous theft of copper cables that is contributing to economic challenges. Insp Ncube urged members of the public to desist from tampering with Zesa equipment, saying this is detrimental to the effective supply of electricity to homes and industries. He said tampering with copper cables also poses a threat to human life. “Theft of copper cables causes a threat to people’s lives and even the thieves themselves as they risk being electrocuted while stealing the copper cables. I strongly appeal to members of the public to desist from tampering with these electric cables,” Insp Ncube said. – @michellzvanyanyan2
