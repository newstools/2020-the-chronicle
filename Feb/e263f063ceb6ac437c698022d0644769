The Chronicle Manchester United are desperately trying to find a buyer for Alexis Sanchez this summer, according to the Manchester Evening News. The Red Devils forward is currently on loan at Inter Milan and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has recently said he would return to Old Trafford this summer. Solskjaer said at the end of January: ‘Alexis will come back in the summer and will prove you all wrong.’ But this looks to be a ploy to ensure his resale value does not dwindle as the Red Devils are scouting for someone to take Sanchez off their books. The 31-year-old has a contract until 2022 and earns £400 000 a week — three quarters of which Inter Milan are paying this season. The Chile international set up Inter’s equaliser in their 4-2 comeback victory over bitters rivals AC Milan on Sunday night. That was his first start since September having been out with an ankle injury for three months. In fact, Sanchez has not completed 90 minutes in any of his 10 appearances since leaving United on loan. The Red Devils are lining up two forwards this summer which would rule out space for Sanchez in the squad. Leicester’s James Maddison and Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish are also of interest as midfield options. — Sportsmail
