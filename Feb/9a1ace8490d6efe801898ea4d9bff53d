The Chronicle Jesse Ncube,  Chronicle Reporter A 54-YEAR-OLD man from Victoria Falls has appeared in court for allegedly raping his 23-year-old daughter. The accused person, who cannot be named to protect the identity of his victim appeared before Victoria Falls magistrate Ms Rangarirai Gakanje who remanded him in custody to February 20 for continuation of trial. The man pleaded not guilty. “I am not the one who raped her and the police arrested the wrong person and how can I rape my own daughter. I am not guilty. There is someone else who raped her who is not me,” he said. For the State, Mr Onias Nyathi said sometime in November last year at midnight, the accused person went to his daughter’s bedroom. He allegedly asked her to follow him to his bedroom hut and she complied. “The complainant proceeded to her father’s bedroom and upon entering, the accused asked her to lie down on his bed facing upwards and he removed the complainant’s clothes and allegedly raped her once without protection,” said Mr Nyathi. The court heard that after the rape, the man allegedly instructed the complainant to put on her clothes and leave the room. He took his belt and threatened to assault her if she disclosed the rape to anyone. The complainant then took all her belongings and went to her bedroom and didn’t tell anyone. A few days later his daughter told her aunt who escorted her to the village head who in turn reported the matter to the police leading to the man’s arrest. The complainant was taken to Victoria Falls hospital for medical examination.-@Zikhali_jay
