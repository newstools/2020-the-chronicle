Prosecuting, Mr Kelvin Guvheya told the court that on February 20, Wafa and Tafadzwa together with a Panashe, who is still at large, connived and proceeded to Gweru-Kwekwe railway line at Nala area. “They started digging armoured electricity copper cables using a digger and a shovel. After digging, they cut the cables into pieces of different sizes using a hacksaw,” he said. The court heard that Wafa and Tafadzwa burnt some of the electric armoured copper cables and retrieved copper wire which they stashed into a sack.

The court heard that a sack of burnt copper wire, rolls of copper cables, a hacksaw, a hacksaw blade, black polythene plastic paper and a mattock handle were recovered.
