Team Zimbabwe again finished last in the second day. The team comprises Graeme Lewis from Harare, Promise Sumburo from Mutare, Martin Kombayi from Zvishavane and Rashid Mohammed from Harare.

Strokeplay means that the total strokes taken during the round or rounds are added together to give a cumulative score. At the end of the round, the golfer’s handicap is subtracted from the total stroke play scores to give each golfer a net score. “The competition is way too good for us. We, however, hope to improve as the championship continues,” said national selector Martin Fikile yesterday. The African Amateur team Golf Championship winds up tomorrow, with Zimbabwe getting straight into the next competition, the South African Amateur Championship.
