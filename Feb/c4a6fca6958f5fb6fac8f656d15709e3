The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter THE Matabeleland Development Initiative (MDI) Trust is planning a Golf Day Education Fundraiser at Bulawayo Golf Club at the beginning of April. MDI is an organisation dedicated to achieving sustainable development, economic growth by investing in education, health as well as environment and economic development in the Matabeleland region. The event will be held under the theme “Investing in Matabeleland through education” and is aimed at boosting and promoting the Matabeleland Education Fund to help disadvantaged learners and schools’ access to education. “MDI is launching the Matabeleland Education Fund to support disadvantaged children and underdeveloped schools. The golf day is a fundraiser for the fund so that we may reach out to as many children as possible” said Nokuthula Ncube, executive board member of MDI. Registration for individual golf is $500, while Stableford golf is $2 000. MDI was founded three years ago by Freeman Ncube and Vusani Khumalo, who are both based in the United Kingdom, with the objective of enriching lives in the Matabeleland region. Other than improving economic growth and development, MDI also seeks to set up a football and netball academy to help in the fight against alcohol and drug abuse as well as teenage pregnancies.
