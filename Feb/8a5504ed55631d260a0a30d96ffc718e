The Chronicle Mejury Magaya, Midlands Reporter A 16-YEAR-OLD teenager from Mberengwa is lucky to be alive after his uncle attempted to burn the hut he was sleeping in following a dispute over inheritance property. This was heard when Gweru Regional magistrate, Mrs Phathekile Msipa, issued a warrant of arrest against Tinayeshe Hove (37) from Mberengwa who skipped court. Hove is facing two counts of attempted murder and malicious damage to property. Prosecutor Mr Kelvin Guvheya told the court that Hove was in default before applying for his warrant of arrest which was issued by the magistrate. Hove, of Mbalawa Village, Chief Chingoma in Mberengwa is a maternal uncle to the complainant Chiratidzo Hove. It is the State case that Chiratidzo’s mother and Hove had a long-standing misunderstanding emanating from their deceased father’s estate and inheritance of property. On May 29, last year at around 10PM, and at Mbalawa Village, Chief Chingoma, Hove allegedly went to Chiratidzo’s homestead and proceeded to a hut in which he was sleeping alone. Chiratidzo was awakened by noise from a barking dog and soon his uncle allegedly approached the window and pushed it wide open. Hove allegedly poured a substance believed to be petrol on his nephew’s bed. Chiratidzo managed to identify his uncle since it was full moon before shouting for help but Hove allegedly continued pouring the substance around the hut from outside and when he got to the door, he set the grass thatch ablaze. Chiratidzo allegedly rushed to open the door but as he went out, he was struck by an iron bar on the groin and he ran back into the burning hut. Hove allegedly left and Chiratidzo bolted out of the burning hut, which was later reduced to ashes.
