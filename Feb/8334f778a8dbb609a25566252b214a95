The Chronicle Walter Mswazie in Masvingo MASVINGO City Council is on a collision course with a number of its tenants who are allegedly subletting premises owned by the local authority. The tenants, mainly trading shops and pre-schools are also accused of not paying rentals, in violation of lease agreements. In an interview yesterday, the director of housing and community services, Mr Levison Nzvura, said council was concerned by the level of dishonesty that many tenants had, as they were violating lease agreements at will, while others had since stopped paying rentals. “We are having challenges with many tenants, especially shops near Mucheke Long Distance Bus Terminus, as they are illegally subletting premises,” said Mr Nzvura. “Most of these tenants are also defaulting on rentals. Some have outstanding debts amounting to more than $60 000. For example, we have Kubatana Pre-School which owes us $67 719.05 as at August, 26, 2019,” he said. He said council has served errant tenants with letters of demand but most of them ignored the reminders. “We are planning to revoke the lease agreements from tenants who are subletting because that is not what we agreed. Our relationship is based on honesty buttressed through religiously paying rentals and not sharing the premises with anyone not in the agreement. We have given them letters of notice and demand for rentals but they have chosen not to care,” he said. According to recent full council minutes, Mr Nzvura noted that cases of non-payment and subletting of premises were rampant among council tenants. “Cases of non-payment of rentals and subletting of premises were noted among tenants at Mucheke Bus Terminus shops. “It was noted that most of the tenants who did not have payment plans with council were already in breach of the lease agreement. This also includes Kubatana Pre-School which owes us more than $67 000,” part of the minutes read. – @waltermswazie2
