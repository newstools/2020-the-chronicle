The Chronicle Rutendo Ngara, Court Reporter A MAN from Fort Rixon in Matabeleland North has been arrested for allegedly stealing and slaughtering his neighbour’s heifer. Moses Moyo (40) from Village Three connived with Dumisani Ncube whose age was not revealed in court and stole Mr Reason Nkala (57)’s heifer which they slaughtered. Ncube is on the run after he escaped from the scene when villagers apprehended Moyo. Moyo appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Lizwe Jamela facing stock theft charges. He was not asked to plead and was remanded in custody to March 6. For the State, Mr Terrence Chakabuda said on Monday between 4PM and 6PM, Moyo and Ncube stole Mr Nkala’s white heifer and slaughtered it. The two allegedly left intestines at the scene. They allegedly carried the meat to Moyo’s field after chopping it into smaller pieces. Mr Chakabuda said Ncube escaped leaving Moyo at the scene after they were intercepted by villagers while putting the meat into sacks. Moyo was arrested and he led police to a pit where he had buried the head of Mr Nkala’s heifer. The prosecutor said Mr Nkala managed to identify the head of his heifer because of its ear marks and tags. “Witnesses in this matter are known to the accused and they fear him because of his violent nature and demeanor therefore if granted bail he might interfere with witnesses and evidence,” said Mr Chakabuda. The value of the stollen heifer was$ 8 000. — @missngara
