The top three boxers in each category in both the men’s and women’s events will automatically qualify for the Olympics. There will be another chance to qualify for the Olympics at the World Qualification Event in Paris, France, in May. “If funds permit, we will send maybe two or three of the boxers to Paris for another shot at the Olympics,” Mathe said. The Olympics boxing tournament will feature 186 male and 100 female boxers competing in 13 weight categories of the global event.
