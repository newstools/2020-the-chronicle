The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly fatally stoning his father last week. Thabani Ncube (47) of Entumbane suburb allegedly murdered his father Mitsho Ncube (83) last Friday in the presence of his child and some neighbours. The motive of the killing was not stated in court. Ncube was not asked to plead to murder charges when he appeared before Western Commonage Magistrate Mr Jeconiah Ncube. He was remanded in custody to March 6. According to court papers, Ncube is not a right candidate for bail as he is of no fixed abode and is temporarily employed hence he may relocate and abscond trial. It is also feared he may interfere with witnesses as one of them is his child . Prosecuting, Mr Tony Kamudyariwa said on Friday last week, Ncube stoned his father at the family’s house in Entumbane suburb but the motive of the attack was not revealed in court. Ncube was arrested on the same day at around 11AM. – @zinyuke98
