The Chronicle Raymond Jaravaza, Sports Correspondent FUTSAL clubs have a fortnight to register with the Zimbabwe Football Association after the national football mother body invited teams that wish to play in provincial leagues to register. The deadline for registration is February 29. Futsal is a variant of the traditional game of football and is played on a hard court, smaller than a football pitch and mainly indoors. It has similarities to five-a-side football. “Zifa invites stakeholders who wish to participate in professional provincial Futsal leagues to urgently register their clubs on or before February 29, 2020. “Acceptance to join the leagues is based on a first come first served basis because slots are limited. “Applications submitted after the deadline will not be considered,” said the association spokesman Xolisani Gwesela. Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. The game is played with a smaller, harder, low-bounce ball. The surface, ball and rules favour ball control and passing in small spaces with the game’s emphasis on improvisation, creativity and technique. The five-a-side facility in Gwabalanda suburb in Bulawayo is ideal for Futsal. The facility is being used by an organisation known as Grassroots Soccer, an adolescent health organisation that uses the power of football to connect with young people and teach them reproductive health and HIV/AIDS. – @RaymondJaravaza/
