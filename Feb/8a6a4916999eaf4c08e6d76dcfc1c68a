Patrols are ongoing, prohibition orders in place and a whole lot of other initiatives like neighborhood watch committees. We need to revive them. Let’s not just look at them as people who just volunteer to assist the police, even as neighbours let’s be concerned about our neighbours house. Home officer scheme also, we want to revive that.
