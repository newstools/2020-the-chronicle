The Chronicle Editor — Examination fees had become a nightmare, well done Minister Cain Mathema!! Halala!! Schools are making a killing from External candidates. Who sets that now? This used to be equal to the subject fee. In any case children will not learn in this country where the factors for education for all are terribly misunderstood. I am convinced our education Ministry is wrongly staffed — no professionals. Headmasters are barking and confusing parents at every corruption-ridden opportunity. ICT, lCT what? Then you make noise that you have not received Paper Letters for circulating senseless instructions. Go back to school and do proper orientation on Administration. We need people who understand the learning environment of the 21st century. Providence Bushowe, Nkulumane 12, Bulawayo
