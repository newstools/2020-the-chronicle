The Chronicle Michell Zvanyanya, Chronicle Reporter THE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has suspended ambulance, refuse collection, attendance to water and sewer faults due to fuel shortages. In a statement yesterday, Bulawayo Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube said challenges in fuel supply will affect the local authority’s ability to offer full Ambulance Services. “The City’s Fire and Emergency Services will be prioritising calls and responding to critical emergencies in terms of the following services; Road traffic accidents, referred Council clinic maternity cases and public collapses. The public is advised to use alternative means until the situation improves,” he said. Mr Dube notified residents that the local authority will not be able to collect refuse or attend to water and sewer faults in the city until the issue of fuel shortages is addressed. “The City of Bulawayo would like to advise residents that there may be an interruption in numerous services such as collection of refuse, attendance to water and sewer faults due to fuel shortages. Residents are advised that Council is working on ensuring speedy delivery of fuel supplies so as to resume normal services,” he said. Mr Dube urged residents to desist from dumping refuse in open spaces and store uncollected refuse within household properties to ensure the city remains clean until the situation returns to normalcy. On December 29 last year, the local authority issued a similar statement suspending emergency services and refuse collection due to fuel shortages. The suspension however, did not come into effect as the situation immediately returned to normalcy. The local authority came under fire from residents who viewed the suspension as highly irresponsible. — @michellzvanyanyan2
