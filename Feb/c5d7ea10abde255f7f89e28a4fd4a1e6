The Chronicle NAIROBI — Tens of thousands of Kenyans gathered at an open air stadium yesterday for the state funeral of Daniel Arap Moi, the country’s longest serving president, who died last week aged 95. Moi’s coffin, draped in the Kenyan flag, was carried on a gun carriage from the State House, the official seat of the presidency, on the 5km route to the stadium in the capital, Nairobi. Troops from the Kenyan army, air force and the navy marched alongside into the stadium, where choirs were singing gospel songs as they awaited the cortege of the man. “Moi was a humble man. Anybody who knew him, they know he was a humble man. President Moi never bragged in any success . . . instead he attributed it to God,” long-time friend Silas Yego, a retired bishop of the Africa Inland Church, where Moi had worshipped, said. “Moi believed if you want to succeed, never tell a lie.” Moi came to power in 1978 when he was serving as vice-president after the nation’s first leader President Jomo Kenyatta died. He remained in power until the end of 2002. Several leaders from the region, including the Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde, Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame, South Sudan’s Salva Kiir and Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni joined President Uhuru Kenyatta and the other mourners at the service. Moi’s son Raymond gave the former president’s eulogy and Kenyatta was also expected to address the crowd. Yesterday was declared a public holiday. — AP
