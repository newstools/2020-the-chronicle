The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter The Public Service Commission (PSC) yesterday said Government could increase to $200 million the low interest loan facility for civil servants as the employer commits to improving the welfare of employees. Cabinet on Wednesday announced the Government Employees Mutual Savings (GEMS) fund and said it would inject $100 million seed capital for the project. The loan facility is meant to promote savings for Government employees as they would get value for their money once a need arises. In a statement yesterday, PSC Permanent Secretary Ambassador Jonathan Wutawunashe said the GEMS initiative would not be forced on employees.  He said those who participate in the loan facility will have 2,5 percent deducted from their salaries. Ambassador Wutawunashe also said the PSC was working on modalities for operationalisation of Garrison Shops for the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, Zimbabwe Police Service and the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service to ensure they access basic commodities. “These Garrison Shops are based on a self-financing model as they entail selling of goods to customers. Logistical arrangements relating to the operationalisation of Garrison Shops are being worked out,” he said. Ambassador Wutawunashe said while uniformed forces would get cheaper products at Garrison shops, the rest of the civil servants will benefit from Silo shops which will also provide affordable goods.-@nqotshili
