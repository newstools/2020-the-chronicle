The Chronicle Hosni Mubarak, Egypt’s president for almost 30 years who stepped down after a popular revolution in 2011, has died. He was 91. Mubarak served as Egypt’s fourth president starting in 1981 until his ouster in what became known as the Arab Spring revolution. He was jailed for years after the uprising, but was freed in 2017 after being acquitted of most charges. The acquittal stunned many Egyptians, thousands of whom poured into central Cairo to show their anger against the court. The Arab Spring protests convulsed autocratic regimes across the Middle East. State television said Mubarak died at a Cairo hospital where he had undergone an unspecified surgery. The report said he had health complications but offered no other details. One of his sons, Alaa, announced over the weekend the former president was in an intensive care after undergoing surgery. His brother-in-law, General Mounir Thabet, said he passed away at Cairo’s Galaa military hospital. Mubarak is survived by his wife, Suzanne, and his sons, Gamal and Alaa.
