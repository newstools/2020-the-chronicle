The Chronicle Editor — Allow me to paint a short motion picture in your beautiful imagination. With pure intent to entice your curiosity and contribute to the imminent well informed citizen in you. We start off our journey at the City Hall. The true North side, underneath the shade of many a large Marula tree. Surrounded by cream to brown stone pebble outdoor tiles, meticulously mown meadow green grass, and an explosion of colour and art from the Fife Street flower, sculpture and beadwork vendors. On our immediate left is the 50-60 feet deep Issels well. So named after a Mr Francois Issels who sank it using explosives in 1895.  Once abandoned and filled in, the well was rediscovered and repaired in 1951. Solely so that it would supply the pool we see just a few feet overhead. The Pioneer’s Memorial Pool. A 66 foot body of fountain and sky clear water that leads us to a now absent Coghlan statue and to a gigantic brass relief depiction of the first of four indabas held in the Matopos in 1896 between the Matabele leaders and Rhodes. We’re now beneath the Town Clock and the Chimes. The Elwyn Chimes in full for they were presented to the city by Mrs E L Wynne, who’d been a Bulawayo resident since 1898. The spellbinding array comprises five bells, the four bell chime thereof being Westminster Chimes. Try to ignore the charm of the cool seemingly ivory tiled foyer now. Don’t give in to the temptation of the staircase on either of our sides. And the picture frames that peep in through the landing. At least not yet, for we have arrived at the library. A branch of the 1896 founded Bulawayo Public Library, this is the Historic Reference Collection. It was opened on July 31st, 1981, and dear reader this is one of the most interesting depositories of historic gems in this part of the country. Is this your first time here? Such enthusiasm. Well, while you take in the daffodil yellow walls, the eighteen pristine towering glass book shelves and cabinets just redolent with enlightenment, here is list of 105 reasons you should visit here more often. 105 fantastic historic books and where to find them. 1.
