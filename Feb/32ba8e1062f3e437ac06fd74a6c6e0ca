The Chronicle Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent A gang of 11 armed men wearing face masks pounced on a Gutu couple and got away with $47 000 and US$7 000 after assaulting them with shovels and iron bars, police have confirmed. The couple had to be admitted to Gutu Mission Hospital where they were treated and discharged. Mr Noah Mugova (39) of Masimba Cash and Carry and his wife, whose name was not given, were bundled in a corridor by eight armed men who had gained entry after breaking windows to the couple’s bedroom. The gang took $47 000 from the house before force-marching the couple to their car parked outside and took another US$7 000. Acting Masvingo police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Kudakwashe Dehwa said the incident occurred on Sunday at around 12am. He said the suspects fled after committing the crime and police have since launched a manhunt.- @walterbmswazie2
