The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Athletics Board (Bab) chairman Manuel Mpofu says the province has a strong team capable of winning medals at the National Athletics of Zimbabwe (Naaz) Cross-Country Championships in Harare this morning. The Championships will provide a platform for athletes to qualify for the Africa Cross-Country Championships set for Togo in March. The Confederation of African Athletics is yet to announce a date for the continental event. Bulawayo will take a team of three athletes to the National Championships. ZRP Fairbridge’s Isaac Mpofu and independent runner Xolani Nkiwane will represent the province in the senior men’s category while Faith Nyathi from City Meats takes part in the senior women’s category. The three runners were selected to represent Bulawayo based on their times in the two selection events held last month at Mpopoma Park. Bulawayo will be hoping to end Harare province’s dominance of the national cross-country event. Mpofu said: “We have assembled a strong squad and we are hoping to emulate the performance last year. Athletes were selected according to their performance. The year has started brightly; we have had two cross country events which had an impressive turnout and the athletes have recorded some good times.” – @innocentskizoe
