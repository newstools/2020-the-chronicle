The Chronicle Rutendo Ngara,  Chronicle Reporter INGWEBU Breweries in partnership with LinkedIn hair salon on Thursday donated mahewu, stationery and free haircuts to pupils at King George V1 Memorial School in Bulawayo. Speaking on the sidelines of the donation handover event, the headmistress Mrs Perseverance Hadebe said the school caters for disabled people and most of them come from vulnerable families that they fail to pay school fees for the children. Through the helping hand from various stakeholders, she said, the school is managing to maintain high educational standards despite economic difficulties. “We are very thankful for what Ingwebu and LinkedIn Salon have done for us.  Truly on our own we could not buy all these things and afford to pay for haircuts for our pupils. As a school we are also facing economic challenges to put our things up to date but through helping hands we are surviving,” said Mrs Hadebe. Ingwebu Sales and Distribution Manager Mr Ray Makwaiba said they want to help the community through philanthropic work. -@missngara
