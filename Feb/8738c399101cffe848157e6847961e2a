The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A MAN from Lovendale suburb in Umguza has appeared in court for allegedly fatally attacking a resident from the same suburb with an axe. Ronaldo Masopo (22) allegedly fatally assaulted Mr Thulani Ndlovu (42) last Saturday in Lovendale suburb which is just outside Bulawayo. Masopo was not asked to plead to murder when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove. He was remanded in custody to March 3. According to court papers, it is suspected that if released on bail, Masopo might abscond trial due to the gravity of the offence or endanger witnesses as they live in the same neighbourhood. The papers also state that Mr Ndlovu has not yet been buried as such releasing Masopo out of custody may endanger his life as the situation is still tense. Prosecuting, Mr Steward Madzore said on Saturday last week, Masopo attacked the late Mr Ndlovu with an axe. The motive of the attack was not stated in court papers. “The accused person struck the complainant with an axe once on the mouth, once on the left side of the neck and once on the leg. The complainant died on the same day at Nkulumane Police Station due to the injuries,” he said. — @zinyuke98
