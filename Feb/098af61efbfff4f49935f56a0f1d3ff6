Government has intensified efforts to recapitalise the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO) as it moves to restore sanity in the public transport sector through the importation of conventional buses from Belarus and China. The latest consignment of 65 buses arrived at Beitbridge Border Post at the weekend where authorities are finalising the importation
formalities. So far, 20 Golden Dragon buses have since arrived on the Zimbabwe side of the border, while the rest are expected to have crossed over tonight. The consignment comes a few months after the Government took receipt of 70 more buses from China. The imports are fruits of agreements signed during President Mnangagwa’s visit to the Asian country in 2018.
