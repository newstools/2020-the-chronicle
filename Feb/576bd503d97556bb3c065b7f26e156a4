The Chronicle Desmond Nleya, Chronicle Reporter THE family of a boy (5) from Heaney Junction on the outskirts of Bulawayo who is suffering from a rare disease that causes stomach swelling is seeking ZWL $3 000 to pay medical bills and buy medication. The boy’s father, Mthokozisi Dube yesterday said he has failed to raise the money since he is unemployed. Mthabisi Dube’s problems started in 2018 and he has been in and out of hospital since. Doctors at Mpilo Central Hospital have referred him to specialists for a heart check-up. Mr Dube said: “He has a problem of swelling in the stomach. However nowadays he even swells in the face and is in great pain. He has been admitted more than ten times and I am now failing to raise money to pay the medical bills which has risen to $1 740 and also to buy him medication which is US$90,” he said. He appealed for financial assistance. “I am failing to raise the money. So, I am appealing to well-wishers to assist me financially as my son’s condition is worsening. I am the one taking care of him and I do not know where his mother is,” he said. A neighbour, a Mrs Zulu said Mr Dube was in a desperate situation and is single handedly taking care of his two children. “He is facing a big problem because he is looking after his two children.  The first born is five and the last born is three years old. Their mother’s whereabouts are not known,” she said. Those willing to help the boy can contact his father on mobile number 0779 125573. @DesmondNdazi.
