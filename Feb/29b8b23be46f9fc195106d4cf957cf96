The Chronicle Joseph Madzimure, Harare Bureau PREPARATIONS for the national prayer meeting scheduled for today, which President Mnangagwa is set to attend, were at an advanced stage with tents and all major requirements having been set by last night. The national prayer meeting was organised by the Zimbabwe Interdenominational Council of Churches (ZICC), a grouping of 110 churches chaired by Bishop Nehemiah Mutendi of the Zion Christian Church. President Mnangagwa is the guest of honour and is expected to give a key note address. It will be held at the National Sports Stadium and will run from 8:30am and end at about 1pm. Bishops from all the churches are invited. Over 400 buses were sourced to move delegates from all the provinces. Spokesperson for the organisers Pastor Richard Takaendesa said some of the delegates started arriving in Harare yesterday. An all-night prayer was scheduled for last night and delegates will break at 6:30am today. “Preparations are well on course. We have set coordinating provincial committees, which will oversee the transportation of the people from various provinces. Some people from provinces such as Gokwe, Masvingo, Manicaland have already arrived,” he said. “Those from Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and South, are on their way. Those from neighbouring provinces such as Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, Mashonaland Central are already here while others will arrive early morning tomorrow (today). “We want everyone to be seated by 8:30am to kick start the programme.” Pastor Takaendesa said the prayer meeting was not for churches but every Zimbabwean willing to build their country. The national prayer meeting runs under the theme: “Joining hands, minds, hearts and voices together in Christ to serve, build and strengthen our nation.”
