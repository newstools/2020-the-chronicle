The Chronicle Former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, the country’s longest-serving leader, has died aged 95. The death of Moi, who ruled Kenya from 1978 to 2002, was announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta in a statement carried by the state broadcaster yesterday. “It is with profound sadness and sorrow that I announce the passing of a Great African Statesman, H.E. Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, the Second President of the Republic of Kenya,” the announcement said. “His Excellency the Former President passed on at the Nairobi Hospital on the early morning of this 4th February, 2020, in the presence of his family,” it said. Kenyatta ordered a period of national mourning until a state funeral is held, on a date not yet announced. Moi had been in hospital for more than a month. Catherine Soi, reporting from Kakamega in western Kenya, said opinion on how people will remember the former leader is divided. “Some people say he started off well in his presidency. He kept the country relatively stable when neighbouring countries were in conflict. He was very passionate about education and built many schools. He was also passionate about the environment and oversaw many tree-planting projects,” Soi said. “Other people will say all that was overshadowed by his reign of terror, detention of political opponents. Several of them died during his time in office,” she added. — AFP
