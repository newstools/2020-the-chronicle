The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE Zimbabwean Community in South Africa will today hold an anti-crime summit in Berea, Johannesburg, under Gauteng province with a view to addressing policing issues affecting immigrants and local communities in the neighbouring country. In a statement yesterday, the organisation’s spokesperson, Mr Bongani Mazwi Mkhwananzi, said they had invited multiple stakeholders among them the police, local political leaders, community leaders, traditional leaders and organisations representing migrants in that country. He said the ZCSA was a non-membership based organisation which represents the interests of Zimbabweans that are based in South Africa. Mr Mkhwananzi said among other things, they had set up a committee to look at issues such as documentation and other areas of interest for Zimbabweans. “We are organising the anti-crime summit. As an organisation, we believe crime is getting out of hand,” he said. “We are also victims of crime as Zimbabweans. The summit will be held under the theme; Building a crime-free environment in our communities. “Our objective is to work with law enforcement agencies to isolate criminal elements in our community and we cannot sit and watch while crime ravages our society and affects our people. “So, we are therefore calling this summit together with law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders to speak on how we can build a crime-free community”. Mr Mkhwananzi said they were looking forward to having the office of the Gauteng Provincial Police Commissioner represented at the summit because they are a key stakeholder in the fight against crime. He said they had also invited the traditional leadership, political leadership and a local councillor had confirmed attendance.
