The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent A GANG of 10 armed robbers attacked a businessman at his homestead in Gwanda and fled with R15 000 and US$275. Four of the suspects, Loveness Nyathi (34), Savious Sibanda (30) and Luckmore Siziba (21) all from Makwe area in Gwanda and Mbonisi Moyo (30) from Mpopoma Suburb in Bulawayo were not asked to plead when they appeared briefly before Gwanda magistrate, Mrs Nomagugu Sibanda, facing a robbery charge. They were remanded in custody to March 3. Prosecuting, Ms Glenda Nare said the gang, three of whom are the complainant’s neighbours, invaded the home of Mr Sheunesu Dube who owns a shop at Makwe Business Centre on January 13 at around 9PM. “The four accused persons together with six others who are still at large went to the complainant’s homestead at around 9PM in a Toyota Hiace while armed with axes and bolt cutters. They cut a perimeter fence and broke the door lock with a bolt cutter and gained entry into the house where Mr Dube was asleep with his wife. “Mr Dube tried to flee but the robbers struck him twice with an axe while his wife managed to flee. They ransacked the complainant’s bedroom and took R10 000. They went to his car which was parked in his yard, smashed the windows, took R5 000 and US$275 before fleeing the scene in their vehicle,’’ said. Ms Nare said the complainant’s wife alerted neighbours of the robbery. She said villagers pursued the gang in another vehicle and caught up with them in a neighbouring village after a 20km chase. Ms Nare said the four accused persons were arrested on the spot while their accomplices fled. – @DubeMatutu
