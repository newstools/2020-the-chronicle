The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A BULAWAYO man has appeared in court for allegedly stealing from his neighbour and assaulting two men on separate occasions following misunderstandings. Reuben Moyo (24) allegedly stole from Mr Freedom Mlauzi (39) before he went on to assault Mr Makhosini Moyo (25) and Mr Fortunate Mhlanga (21). Moyo is Mr Mlauzi neighbour in Pumula South while Mr Mhlanga lives in Makokoba suburb. Moyo was not asked to plead to theft and two counts of assault when he appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove. He was remanded in custody to March 3. Prosecuting, Mr Steward Madzore said on July 1 and July 2 last year between 5PM and 6AM, Moyo connived with Never Phiri who is still at large and went to Mr Mlauzi’s house where they allegedly jumped over a precast wall into the yard. “While inside, the accused persons stole a shovel, an axe, a digger, a spare wheel and a four-pound hammer. The duo sold the stolen property to an unidentified man who was later seen selling it at Pumula shops,” he said. The man was interrogated about the property and he implicated Moyo. “On December 6 last year at around 4PM, Mr Makhosini was playing draughts with his friends in the neighbourhood when he was approached by the accused person in the company of five unidentified accomplices who are still at large. The gang accused the complainant of disrespecting them. They punched and slapped him all over the body,” Mr Madzore said. The man sustained injuries on the right ear and the eyes. On 11 December last year, Moyo allegedly attacked Mr Mhlanga (21) of Makokoba suburb with a steel chair several times on his head, back and right arm. The matter was reported to the police leading to Moyo’s arrest.-@zinyuke98
