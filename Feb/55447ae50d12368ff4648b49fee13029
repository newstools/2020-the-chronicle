The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief THE Government is yet to approve Gweru City Council’s $1,8 billion 2020 budget, a development which the local authority says is affecting service delivery. In an interview yesterday, Mayor Councillor Josiah Makombe said they were still using the 2019 budget tariffs. The move, he said, will leave them in a deficit as they are being forced to charge less while they are paying more for services to providers that are charging monies which are in line with the prevailing economic environment. “Government hasn’t approved our $1,8 billion budget for the year and it is proving to be a challenge for the local authority. It’s now two months into the year and we are still billing using the 2019 rates which were approved by the Government. As a city we can’t remain viable considering the current economic environment,” he said. Clr Makombe said he was optimistic that the Government would approve the budget before the end of the month. “We hear that some budgets for other local authorities have been approved and it is our hope that we are next so that we introduce new tariffs and licences which conform to the prevailing economic situation,” he said. Last week, council relented to the residents’ outcry over high tariffs demanded in the $1,8 billion 2020 budget – reducing them by 40 percent as part of a new budget implementation matrix. Clr Makombe said if the Government approves the budget, council would only increase tariffs and licences by 40 percent to cushion ratepayers. “Yes, we proposed a $1,8 billion budget to Government and yes we are still waiting for its approval. Even if it’s approved, council will effect a 40 percent cut to cushion the ratepayers. Then in April we will revise it again in line with the prevailing economic situation,” he said. Council had proposed exorbitant charges in tariffs and levies which received a huge outcry from the residents and businesses. The 2020 budget has already seen services being hiked sharply with burial fees having been scaled up from $80 to $1 097 while council-owned two-roomed houses in Mkoba where tenants who were paying $40 per month would have to fork out $600. Occupation certificate fee for home-seekers was raised from $30 to $5 000 while beacon relocation costs went up to $9 000 from $150. A fuel service station license that is renewed annually rose from $3 000 to $84 000. Yearly licence fees for surgeries are now $40 000. Taxi licence fees rose from $85 to $1 419 per year. Buses and minibuses using the Kudzanayi bus terminus were meant to part with $3 547, up from last year’s $150. Vendors and hawkers were meant to pay $1 182 for a vending licence, up from last year’s $50 per term.
