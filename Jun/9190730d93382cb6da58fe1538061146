THE Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) successfully held an executive programmes meeting on Wednesday and adopted two more commissions into its structures. In January the BVA enlisted various committees into its structures, as it seeks to make its brand more marketable and reach out to stakeholders more effectively. These were the referee’s commission, players commission, marketing commission and gender commission. On Wednesday the coaches and corporate commissions were added. “We discussed a number of issues and one of the most key discussions was preparation for the resumption of volleyball activities. We looked at how stakeholders must prepare for the resumption of games, for example, looking at how the fixtures are going to be structured, how we are going to avoid too much contact and the venues that we are going to be used and also how referees are going to conduct themselves. The equipment we use will need to be sanitised, including the balls. We need to have all necessary precautionary measures in place,” said BVA secretary-general Munyaradzi Chigudu. He said the coaches commission is responsible for team selection at provincial and national levels. It will also focus on building capacity for coaches. The BVA season was set to get underway on March 21, with the traditional pre-season opener at Milton High School before sporting activities were suspended due to the national lockdown to curb Covid-19. — @innocentskizoe
