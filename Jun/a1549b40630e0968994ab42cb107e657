SIX-YEAR-OLD Axellia Nyamadzawo, who was allegedly killed by her mother in Durban, South Africa a week ago, was buried at Msasa Park Cemetery in Kwekwe on Sunday. Her mother Fungai Nyamadzawo (42), has since been arraigned before Umhlali Magistrates Court facing a murder charge. Her bail application was dismissed. Unconfirmed reports also suggest that the mother who murdered her daughter in a suspected ritual killing, is not mentally stable. In a graveside speech, Axellia’s grandfather, Mr Reason Nyamadzawo said the family had forgiven their daughter-in-law. “The most important thing is that as a family we have forgiven our daughter-in-law. It is important for us to forgive her and move on if we want to make heaven our home. Everybody makes mistakes in life and it is not our duty to judge,” said Mr Nyamadzawo. He said although Fungai’s family did not attend the funeral, they had called to apologise and rendered their support. “We have been talking to our in-laws and we are in good books. They called and we talked about the matter. The most important thing now is that we stand by the family in this time of need and support each other,” said Mr Nyamadzawo. Axellia’s father, Titus, could not attend the funeral due to coronavirus-induced travel restrictions. “He only travelled to the border where he left the body which we then took for the final resting place here in Kwekwe,” said Mr Nyamadzawo.
