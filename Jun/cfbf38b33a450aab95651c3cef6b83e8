The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent A FISHERMAN drowned in a dam in Kwekwe during a fishing expedition with a colleague when their boat capsized after a hippopotamus attack. Ndumiso Nyamazana (age not given) died instantly while Mr Emmanuel Moyo escaped with injuries after their canoe was attacked by a hippopotamus at Dutchman’s pool in Kwekwe on last Saturday. Police confirmed the incident. Midlands Police Spokesperson Inspector Joel Goko said the hippo barrelled into the canoe while the duo was casting nets at the middle of Dutchman’s pool. “Unfortunately, Ndumiso Nyamazana died on the spot while his friend Emmanuel managed to swim to safety,” said Inspector Goko. Police sub aqua unit retrieved the body on Sunday morning while Moyo was rushed to Kwekwe General Hospital where he was treated and discharged. Inspector Goko urged the public to desist from playing in water bodies. “We are saying the public should stay away from water bodies whenever necessary and avoid activities that endanger their lives. The sad loss of life could have been avoided if people had stayed away from water bodies,” said Inspector Goko.
