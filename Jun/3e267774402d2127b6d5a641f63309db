DANCE kingpins and queens Sungura Masters are set to break an over 100-day jinx of not setting a foot on the stage this Friday as they are billed to perform at the Creative Diversity and Social Inclusion (Credisi) concert on Friday night. Since the closure of bars and nightspots on March 30, Sungura Masters have not been able to set foot on the dance floor, something which has been depressing the group. The group from Entumbane earlier this year shifted base to the capital in search of greener pasture, a move that was short-lived due to the pandemic. Sungura Masters leader Masotha Nzou said not being able to perform was affecting them adding that they are grateful for the inclusion on Credisi, an Iyasa initiative. He said emotions of joy are arousing in the outfit which is excited to be back on stage. “This will be our first time performing since the lockdown started and we’re happy and emotional at the same time. Just the thought of not knowing when we’ll we be on stage again was devastating.” He said the group will be in top form on Friday with fans in for a treat. – @mthabisi_mthire
