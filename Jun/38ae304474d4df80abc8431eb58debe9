The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Coaches Association (Zisca) Bulawayo chapter is set to donate to families that lost loved ones in the diarrhoea outbreak in Bulawayo. Twelve people have died since diarrhoea broke out in Bulawayo’s Luveve suburb last month. The city’s health department visited 279 homes, mostly in Luveve suburb, in a campaign to identify patients. Government has attributed the disease outbreak to Bulawayo’s 144-hour water shedding exercise and vandalism of sewerage pipes. Zisca says it has since received contributions from its members to assist those affected by the outbreak. “We feel it is part of our duty to lend a helping hand in our communities. As an association we will make a donation to the affected families from contributions we got from our members. For now, all contributions have come in the form of cash, but we are still open to those that can chip in in kind. We want to hand over our donation on Monday, so we are still open for more contributions from those willing to assist,” said Kona Tshabangu, a Zisca committee member. Residents have blamed the city’s water for the diarrhoea outbreak, but tests are yet to validate those claims. Water quality tests done by the Bulawayo City Council, National University of Science and Technology and Cimas laboratories have been inconclusive. @innocentskizoe
