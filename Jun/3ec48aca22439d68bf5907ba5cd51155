The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter WHEN news that Bulawayo would host the 2014 African Union Sports Council (AUSC) Region 5 Under-20 Youth Games broke, there was an aura of happiness within the business sector and residents in general. Here was a chance for the country’s second largest city to market itself to the world; a chance for the dying industry to be resuscitated; a chance for the unemployed youths to get an income as volunteers before and during the Games. There were lots of expectations from residents of this culturally rich city that had last played host to a major international sporting event way back in 1995 when some All-Africa Games competitions spilled over into Bulawayo. The 1995 All-Africa Games, now known as the Africa Games, saw massive structural work being done at Barbourfields Stadium. <img class="wp-image-502101 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/White-City-lawn-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/White-City-lawn.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/White-City-lawn-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> File picture: Workers laying the lawn at White City Stadium in preparation of the 2014 Ausc Games. Prior to that the stadium used to host football matches but since the “facelift”, it hasn’t Those memories were still vivid in older residents’ minds and they saw the coming of the 2014 AUSC Games as another opportunity for the city’s sporting infrastructure to get a facelift, while companies that had bravely resisted the temptation of relocating to Harare suddenly thought a huge window of opportunity had availed itself and they would reap the fruits of their loyalty. Organisers of the Games and even the Government clearly stated that staging the Games in Bulawayo would leave a lasting legacy in terms of infrastructural development. Former President Robert Mugabe publicly declared that Bulawayo would never be the same again after the Games, boldly declaring that the city will never die, while speaking at the torch lighting ceremony in September 2014. He indicated that the Government had taken a deliberate decision to bring the Games to Bulawayo because the city was badly affected by illegal sanctions ravaging the country’s economy which have resulted in virtually all industries either relocating to Harare or closing shop. “It was the centre and is still the centre, the capital of our railway systems and of course for some of us who have lived around there and whose parents also worked that side, have much sentiment within us, an undying sentiment for Bulawayo. So there it is now, this is it now along with other activities, socio-economic activities are also taking place, reviving the city, reviving the industries gradually, the railways system, the transport system,” said the late former Head of State and Government. <img class="wp-image-502103 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/swimming-pool-news-article-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/swimming-pool-news-article.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/swimming-pool-news-article-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chronicle Sport highlights the poor state of Bulawayo swimming pool two weeks after the Ausc Games had ended in 2014 However, when real work in preparation for the Games got underway, only a few Bulawayo-domiciled firms were awarded tenders; five to be exact, while 18 were all from Harare and one from South Africa. Bulawayo companies that were lucky to be subcontracted got small jobs worth a few thousands US dollars. As if that was not enough embarrassment and pain, those responsible for remunerating contracted companies prioritised Harare firms, leaving Bulawayo companies worse off than they were before the games. Jobs were lost and most of the Bulawayo firms and residents that rendered services remain unpaid six years later. It seems some people did not want those Games to come to Bulawayo and were not amused that the Government brought them to the City of Kings. This probably explains why some officials (names withheld) in the Ministry of Sport and Recreation covertly arranged a meeting between former Vice-President Joice Mujuru and the late AUSC Region 5 secretary-general Mvuzo Mbebe to try and get the Games moved to Harare. “So if the VP can say yes, she will be the right person to go to the President with the strong view, what is that? I would never have accepted it and I am glad she rebuffed him (Mbebe) and said no,” the late former President Mugabe said during the torch lighting ceremony. Some people were angry that Bulawayo would shine. A lot of questions still remain unanswered, particularly why Bulawayo firms and volunteers remain unpaid. What is undeniable is that looting of massive proportions was executed mainly by high ranking officials in the Ministry of Sport. Corruption at any level and in any sector must be condemned and those involved must face the full wrath of the law. While the 2014 AUSC Region 5 Games should have helped uplift the city of Bulawayo, sadly the opposite happened. Harare-based contracted companies did a shoddy job and left some facilities in a worse state than they were before. White City Stadium can’t be used for Premier Soccer League matches because the pitch is uneven and rocky due to careless construction work that was done. Work to dig up the pitch and re-lay a new playing turf is now the burden of stadium owners Bulawayo City Council, yet thousands of US dollars were paid to companies that did the shoddy job. The athletics track is in a mess because the company that was paid in full only chose to lay the tartan track on only 100m. Bulawayo City Pool should be having a heating system to ensure swimming can be held throughout the year, but the Harare company contracted to install the heating system installed something that doesn’t work. The sad reality about all this is that these companies were paid good money in full for work they never did and there has been no attempt whatsoever to bring them to book for the massive fraud they committed in Bulawayo in 2014. And most of the Government officials that helped these companies in this massive deception continue to serve in their roles. The truth is that the city of Bulawayo was used and dumped.
