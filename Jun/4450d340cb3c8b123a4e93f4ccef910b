FARMERS in Insiza district have partnered a South African based investor to rehabilitate an 800-hectare irrigation project at an estimated cost of about R20 million. The project seeks to revive Further Stone Irrigation, which has been lying idle for more than 10 years. The development is set to help improve food supply in the district and the entire province of Matabeleland South. It will also create employment for the local community. Insiza District Development Coordinator, Mr Zacharia Jusah, said the target this year was to plant 66 hectares. He said five local A2 farmers had partnered an SA based investor, Louis Leroux to implement the project. “We have a project to rehabilitate an 800-hectare irrigation scheme in Insiza which has been initiated by local farmers. There used to be an irrigation scheme in the area but the land has been lying idle for the past 10 years and now the entire infrastructure including the canals need to be replaced,” said Mr Jusah. “Five farmers from the area through Government have partnered an SA based investor Louis Leroux to rehabilitate this irrigation scheme,” said Mr Jusah. He said 50 locals had been engaged to prepare the 66 hectare for planting this year. “This project will go a long way in ensuring availability of food at local markets and it will also create employment for many people,” said Mr Jusah. — @DubeMatutu.
