SOUTH African police have launched a manhunt for a 25-year-old Zimbabwean man who escaped from a prison in Limpopo province on Wednesday morning. Knowledge Lucky Mashava escaped from remand prison in the Hlanganani policing area close to Giyani. He had been remanded in custody in the neighbouring country pending trial for nine cases that include murder, robberies and burglaries. Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo yesterday said a manhunt for Mashava was underway. “The suspect who is a Zimbabwean national was arrested for nine offences that he allegedly committed from June 2018 to February 2020 around Hlanganani, Giyani and Letsitele policing areas. The cases against him include murder, house and business robberies as well as burglaries at residential places,” he said. “Preliminary investigations revealed that the escapee used an unknown object to cut open a certain portion in the cell building”. Brig Mojapelo said anyone with information that could assist police to locate the suspect should contact the nearest police station or Captain Marivate on 0027 82 468 8673 and the crime hotline on 002686 001 10111. He also advised members of the public against attempting to apprehend Mashava since he is considered to be a dangerous man. The police spokesperson said they were also investigating circumstances surrounding Mashava’s escape from prison. Jailbreaks, especially by those awaiting trial, are common in Limpopo Province. Over 30 people among them Zimbabweans have escaped from remand prison in the last 12 months. — @tupeyo
