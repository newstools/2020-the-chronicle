Asaph who this year produced his hit song Like So, is not slowing down as he was recently featured on a Pungwe Sessions collaboration which features Ammara Brown, Rymez and Sylent Nqo. The song titled Calling was produced by United Kingdom-based producer Rymez and was released on YouTube last week. The collaborative project was initiated by Rymez through his Pungwe Sessions which are meant to promote local artistes and change the music landscape. <img class="wp-image-485360 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Asaph13-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Asaph13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Asaph13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Asaph Commenting on the collaboration, Asaph said: “The song is part of a project that featured a number of Zimbabwean artistes who worked together on a beat that was produced by Rymez. The song which belongs to all of us as it’s a collaborative project was done last year.” He said the song is now available on online music platforms including Spotify and Apple Music. The Pungwe Sessions which are now on Volume 2, feature 13 songs from local artistes including Simba Tagz, Nutty O, Garry Mapanzure, GZE, Asaph, Boss Pumacol, Chengeto Brown, Soko Matemai, King Kandoro, Michael Chiunda, Sylent Nqo, Thaiwanda and Shashl. Pungwe Sessions Volume 2 is a follow up to the 2014 offering that Rymez produced alongside Point Black MD and Phil Chard. The initial session saw hip-hop songs such as Phil Chiyangwa by Rymez and Junior Brown being produced. – @mthabisi_mthire.
