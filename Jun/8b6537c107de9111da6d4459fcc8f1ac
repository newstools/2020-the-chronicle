The stage is set for the BET Awards that take place today with all eyes on Zimbabwe’s Sha Sha who is nominated for the Viewer’s Choice: Best New International Act award. Earlier this month, Sha Sha became the first Zimbabwean to be nominated for the awards that seek to showcase the best and most beautiful aspects of the Black experience — celebrating Black music’s present and future and elevating the culture and being a driving force for social change. She is up against Rema (Nigeria) Celeste (UK), Young T & Bugsey (UK), Hatik (France) and Stacy (France). Observing the BET Instagram voting platform, Sha Sha was facing very stiff competition from Rema whose votes were double hers so it is a tough battle for her. Long and short, her chances of winning the award are very slim, but like fellow musician Jah Prayzah put it, Sha Sha is already a winner because the nomination on its own was a big endorsement of her music. The winner will be unveiled early this morning as the awards that are taking place online because of the Covid-19 pandemic, are expected to start streaming on BET Africa (DStv channel 129) at 2AM CAT. For those who will not be able to watch live because of the time, a repeat of the event will be shown at 8PM. Also nominated at the awards are Africans — Burna Boy and Sho Madjozi who are up against each other in the Best International Act category. Their category is similar to Sha Sha’s but the difference is that this one is adjudged by the show’s judges while Sha Sha’s will be determined by the voting public. Madjozi has done exceptionally well for herself because last year, she won a BET in the category Sha Sha is nominated in.
