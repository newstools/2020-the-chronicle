AN alert Bulawayo Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube yesterday thwarted an attempt to steal by a daring thief who had sneaked into his bedroom in one of the city’s leafy suburbs. The incident occurred shortly after 3AM in Burnside suburb. The lone intruder got into Mr Dube’s premises through a neighbour’s yard before he cut an electric fence diving the two properties. Soon after accessing Mr Dube’s yard, the suspect destroyed a padlock mounted on the veranda burglar bars using a bolt cutter to gain entry before he proceeded to the bedroom. The vigilant Mr Dube was already up when the unsuspecting thief tiptoed into his bedroom under the cover of darkness. When the thief noticed that he had been spotted, he stormed out of the house and melted into darkness empty-handed with Mr Dube hot in pursuit. “Upon noticing that I was already up, he bolted out of the house and disappeared in the darkness. It appeared it’s someone who just wanted to steal and disappear, but he ran out of luck. I thought he was going to attack us, but he bolted out without even stealing anything. He was not armed,” he said. Mr Dube said he spotted the suspect’s footprints and reported the matter to the police and no arrests have been made. — @mashnets
