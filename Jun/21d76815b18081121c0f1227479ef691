ZIMBABWE is focused on increasing domestic production in a robust drive to develop and diversify exports, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade has said. The country needs to beef up its foreign exchange earnings to enhance currency stability, which is a key ingredient to economic growth. The productive sector needs forex resources to import key raw materials and equipment while more is needed in securing essential products such as fuel and drugs. While these are critical, Government and the private sector are equally mindful of the need to bolster domestic production to substitute unnecessary imports so as to save forex resources. “With the national thrust to develop and promote exports of a diversity of commodities, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ZimTrade are visiting exporting companies to assess the state of export industries and appreciate the challenges being faced and efforts being made to export,” posted the ministry in it’s official Twitter handle. On Monday Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister, Dr Sibusiso Moyo, visited a detergent manufacturing company, Trade Kings Zimbabwe (Pvt) Limited, at its manufacturing plant in Workington, Harare. He was accompanied by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Dr Mavis Sibanda and ZimTrade chief executive officer, Mr Allan Majuru. “We love to see #Zim companies taking advantage of regional opportunities. Today we paid a visit to #TradeKings#Boom along with @MoFA_ZW. #Boom has successfully entered into Zambian and Mozambique markets with plans to increase exports taking advantage of regional trade agreements,” ZimTrade Twitted.
