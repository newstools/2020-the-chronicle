THE Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) has moved towards being compliant with the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation’s requirements by naming a pool of about 180 players for national teams. The ministry, through the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) has directed sporting associations to submit a pool of athletes from which to select national teams. ZVA named 30 players for each age group, the senior men and women, Under-23 men and women. The remainder are for beach volleyball teams, the senior men and women, and Under-19 squads. “Those squads are part of what the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation asked us to do. We came up with standing squads of 30 per age group, including senior teams. The other age group squads will be out soon. “By having these teams on standby, it makes it easy to communicate with the Government when asking for funding anytime the players assemble for competitions,” said Brian Manuel, ZVA vice-president responsible for national teams. ZVA is one of the few associations that were commended by the SRC for administrative compliance. The SRC gave national sports associations a time frame to be compliant, warning that those that fail to meet their obligations will be sanctioned. Besides the meetings, organisations must ensure they give their athletes training programmes to follow at home. ZVA has been holding virtual meetings during the Covid-19 lockdown and their players have adopted an indoor training programme. Sports personalities throughout the world have had to come up with innovative ways of keeping themselves in good shape during the global lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The ZVA Facebook timeline has been active, educating the public about the virus. It’s also running a lockdown competition whereby players post their lockdown exercises from their homes. — @ZililoR
