AFRICAN Sun Hotels and Resorts says it will be re-opening Troutbeck Resort starting Wednesday (1 July 2020)  after the business closed operations in March. The hotel industry closed business under the first national lockdown measures following the global outbreak of the Covid-19 Pandemic. In a press statement African Sun Hotels and Resorts said it used the lockdown period as opportunity to complete refurbishments at Troutbeck Resort to ensure the facility matches with modern and international customer trends. “The just completed refurbishment covered the reception area, restaurant, kitchen, sun lounge, main lounge, an additional coffee shop, a gazebo and an all new braai area across the river,” said the group. “A new 16 seater solar paneled boat, mountain bikes as well as an outdoor fitness centre, which includes eight obstacles for the fitness lovers have been added to the activities pool. “Guests booking in the months of July and August get to enjoy up to 50 percent off accommodation.” Other activities available at the resort include canoeing, paddle boating, trout fishing, horseback riding, tennis courts and peaceful nature walks in and around the estates’ serenic woods. Troutbeck Resort was built and founded by Major Herbert Macllwaine in 1947 and has undergone considerable changes over the years in keeping with current trends to deliver the best experience for our guests. The famous log fire that was lit when the hotel first opened its doors over 70 years ago continues to burn and provide a warm welcome to this day. The hotel is 6 500 feet (2 200m] above sea level with the surrounding mountains climbing to 8 508 feet (2 593ml) above sea level. The African Sun group also runs other hotel divisions across the country such as City and Country Hotels, Resort Hotels and The Victoria Falls Hotel. The company’s hotels are located in all major cities and prime tourist destinations.
