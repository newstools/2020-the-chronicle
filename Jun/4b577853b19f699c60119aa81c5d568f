THE country’s trade development and export promotion agency, ZimTrade, says efforts are underway to establish an export cluster in Matabeleland North province to assist producers from different sectors to tap into the export market. The province is endowed with rich natural resources such as timber, coal, gold, arable land and wildlife with a variety of businesses exploiting these. One other key activity that has recently gained limelight in terms of exports is art and craft, with the Lupane Women’s Centre emerging as one of success stories in the province. “The Lupane Women’s Centre has been ensuring sustenance of women’s livelihoods through art and craft since 1995. Currently, they work with more than 400 women in Lupane. “We are working to establish an export cluster in Mat’north that will leverage on their skills and potential,” said ZimTrade in post on its official Twitter handle. The trade promotion agency has recently done surveys in different global markets, which indicate that art and craft products could increase the country’s export earnings in a big way. Zimbabwe needs to grow her exports to reduce pressure on the foreign exchange front, which has been a source of price volatility.
