ARTISTES, who include Europe-based Vusa Mkhaya, Martin Sibanda of Ndolwane Super Sounds and Madlela Skhobokhobo have been roped in to assist in the Highlanders debt clearance campaign. Bosso have started settling their legacy debt in installments after receiving $100 000 from a crowd-funding initiative spearheaded by fans. At the beginning of May, the club’s South African chapter rolled out a crowdfunding initiative aimed at extinguishing the debt, which stands at $862 868. South African-based Bosso member Nodumo Nyathi, who is leading the initiative, said the prominent artists have volunteered to drive the project. “A video of prominent artistes has been done to market the fundraising initiative. Our hope is that their popularity will influence more Highlanders people to become part of this humble initiative,” said Nyathi. Last month, Bosso fans raised $100 000 and they are hoping to surpass the figure this month. – @ZililoR
