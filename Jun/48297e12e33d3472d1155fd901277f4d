A HIGH Court judge has sent a Lupane man who bludgeoned his ailing visually impaired grandfather to death after he rebuked him for attempting to rape his cousin, to Mlondolozi ‘mental’ prison. Anthony Dube of Mabhonobono Village in Lupane, who was 33 years old when he used a pick handle to strike his grandfather May Mlilo (84) on the head and back two years ago, was facing a murder charge. A psychiatrist, Dr Nemache Mawere who examined Dube at Khami Prison’s Mlondolozi Special Institution said he was mentally disturbed and suffering from mild intellectual disability and substance induced psychosis when he committed the offence.” Court documents showed that Dube had a known history of mental illness and was once committed to Mlondolozi Prison. His grandmother Mrs Girlie Mlilo, who is the deceased’s wife also told investigators that Dube dropped out of school at Form Two because of mental retardation. She said her grandson abused alcohol and mbanje and had auditory hallucinations where he would hear voices and see visions. On the fateful day, Dube had tried to forcibly enter his cousin, Ms Hlengiwe Nyathi’s bedroom hut through the window at night and got angry when she reported to the deceased that he wanted to rape her, according to court documents. Based on Dube’s mental history, Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Maxwell Takuva who is on circuit in Hwange retained a special verdict and committed him to Mlondolozi Prison. — @ncubeleon.
