STARBRITE talent show is calling on aspiring youthful artistes who want to take their career to the next level to register for the auditions that are being held online. The online auditions are for the show’s ninth season and are targeting artistes who are into singing, dancing, poetry and magic among other forms of art. The show’s executive producer, Barney Mpariwa said the auditions will run till the end of July with qualifying participants set to go on a boot camp where they will be trained. “Against the Covid-19 background where huge gatherings are discouraged, we’ve had to reinvent our show and come up with a format that helps sustain its continuity. “Interested people should record a video of themselves performing their best act in a landscape position where sound must be clear with good lighting and background. The person should first say their name, place and phone number and the entire clip to be sent on WhatsApp number 0774 407 924 must be 60 seconds or less,” said Mpariwa. He said they have since registered over 300 people countrywide and have managed to reach those in periphery areas who they were not able to access in past auditions. Successful candidates will be posted on Starbrite’s social media platforms. Currently, Starbrite season 8 is being shown on ZBCtv on Thursdays and Fridays at 5PM. The show has managed to unearth talent that includes Kure hit-maker Ishan, Zimbabwe’s house sensation Novuyo Seagirl, Willom Tight, Prudence Katomeni Mbofana, Bryan K, Pro Beats, Mateo, Tendai Chidarikire and Nyasha Timbe among others. – @mthabisi_mthire
