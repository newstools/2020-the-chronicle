The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA has availed before the Appeals Committee a receipt showing a staggering $120 000 as proof of payment for their appeal hearing against vice president Gift Banda with questions lingering on who authorised the upward review of the appeal fees from the previous $3000. The receipt, serial number 2203, which Chronicle online is in possession of, is dated March 9, 2020 and on the face, just below the signature line, its written, in capital letters APPEAL FEE BANDA CASE. Payment was made to the Zifa account and it is indicated on the receipt that it was an intra-transfer. However, while it still remains to be seen how Zifa were able to move money from and to the same account through electronic means, the resolution to increase the appeal fees is another mystery as they have not been any congress since the May 25, 2019 meeting. Appeal fees are rectified by a full congress and Zifa are yet to hold one having postponed the 2020 congress to September due to the Covid-19 pandemic while the issue was never brought for discussion in their last congress in 2019. Resolutions of the 2019 Zifa Congress held in Harare on May 25, 2019.
