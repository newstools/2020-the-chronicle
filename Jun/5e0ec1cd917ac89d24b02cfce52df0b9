ZIMBABWE’S hip hop sensation Cal Vin, the first artiste to collaborate with Amapiano queen Sha Sha, says it was great working with the BET nominee. The two artistes’ studio relationship dates back to 2015 when they first met in Harare where a hip hop trap sound engulfed a studio and two ambitious voices gave the track titled Miss Independent some life. Popularly known as That Luveve Boy, Cal Vin said he was able to nail his verse on the track in just an hour as a freestyle. “I was in Harare for the Harare International Festival of the Arts and I got a call from Audius Mtawarira’s people to come to the studio where there was Sha Sha, Buffalo Souljah and Zabs from Botswana. “It was more like a chillas of music creatives in one space. Sha Sha played me a record she had done which is the song that we ended up doing together as she wanted Ndebele bars on that song. “We just did it. I don’t write so I just dropped the verse and did my thing from the head. It was probably for about 30 minutes to an hour,” said the rapper. Cal Vin revealed that a video of the song was later shot, but was not released as the quality was not satisfactory for Mtawarira. “When the song was released, it was a hit and got radio airplay at ZiFM Stereo, Star FM and other radio stations. This happened way before Sha Sha was this big and it was amazing working with her as she was talented,” he said. — @mthabisi_mthire.
