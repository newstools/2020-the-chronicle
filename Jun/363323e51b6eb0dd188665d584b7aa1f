A VISIT to South Africa before the borders were locked due to the Covid-19 pandemic has come as a blessing in disguise for novelist Lifter Mlevu “Molefe” Ndlovu who is using this time to promote his works online. Ndlovu, an author from Nyamandlovu said he is now spending most of his time online, something he would have never done back home. The 40-year old author said many had advised him to grow his presence online but he was finding it difficult to do so back home because of other commitments. The lockdown has therefore provided Molefe with all the time he needs to promote his works online as he now has a social media presence on his Lifta Mlevu Molefu Facebook page. His first book titled Yimi Engabulala Indwangu Epokayo is doing the rounds on Facebook, something which has encouraged him to continue sharing his works online. “Yimi engabulala indwangu epokayo is my first book. I shared it online and before being launched officially, it has sold close to 200 copies online. “I already have a backlog of more than a 100 people who’ve ordered the book which tackles issues of lobola requirements among others,” said Molefe. He said the passion to jot down thoughts on paper came about when he was doing his primary education at St Peters Primary School. He started off with poems and before her knew it, he had become a force to reckon with in the Ndebele literature. Molefe said people started inviting him to recite poems in both Ndebele and English at public gatherings. He said when he was at secondary school, he joined the drama club and was so good that he ended up assisting their teacher to write drama scripts. Some of his poems took first prizes in 1994 and 1995 in the schools competition that was held at ZITF. He paid homage to his late grandfather who he said nurtured his talent by sharing literature from back in the days. — @mthabisi_mthire.
