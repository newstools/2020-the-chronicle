TWO MDC-Alliance councillors in Kwekwe who are facing charges of partaking in an illegal demonstration have been further remanded to next month for provision of a trial date. Ward 5 councillor, Melody Chingarande (41) and her Ward 12 counterpart, Washington Moyo are being jointly charged together with 40 party activists over an illegal demonstration in March. They were not asked to plead when they initially appeared before Kwekwe Magistrate Cheryl Tembo and were each released on $1 000 bail and were remanded to July 6. It is the State’s case that on 20 March 2020, Chingarande and Moyo, together with one Takatsaurwa Lovemore Savanhu, Sekai Marashe and 38 others converged at a house in Mbizo section 5 where they hatched a plan to conduct an unauthorised demonstration. The group allegedly rallied around Mbizo 4 shopping centre in Kwekwe chanting songs that denounced President Mnangagwa. It is alleged that after getting wind that police were on their way to quell the demonstration, the group quickly dispersed and everyone went to their homes. Mbizo police, however, carried out investigations leading to the arrest of the councillors who implicated the 40 activists. Mr Kudakwashe Mazorodze is representing the State.
