After thrilling online audiences with their performance at the Nash TV Friday Night Live show recently where they performed alongside Jah Prayzah, much-celebrated dance outfit, Iyasa will be returning to Harare this week for another virtual show that will see them sharing the stage with Winky D and guitarist Sylent Nqo. The show which is being bankrolled by PPC Zimbabwe will be streamed live on Friday on ZTN, Zimbo Live, Zim Celebs and PPC Facebook pages from 7pm to 8pm. PPC general manager, sales and marketing Nkosana Mapuma said they are now doing the final preparations for the show which will serve as a launch of the rebranding of their iconic cement brand to PPC Surerange. Iyasa director Nkululeko Dube said they were geared to thrill audiences once again. “We’re looking forward to another great online outing and it’s a pleasure to play alongside the country’s best. Following our reception at the last event, we’ll try to raise the bar again. “In these tough Covid-19 times, we take every opportunity we’re presented with, to showcase our work very seriously.” Speaking from his base in Harare, Winky D through his manager Jonathan Banda said: “We’ll try by all means to ensure we come up with fireworks as always. Our aim is to alleviate the distress coming out of the pandemic. Entertainment is a key component in life.” Guitarist Sylent Nqo said: “It’s just gonna be an awesome show. This is one of my first public appearances since the start of the lockdown and I’m happy to be sharing the stage with these artistes who are my favourites.”
