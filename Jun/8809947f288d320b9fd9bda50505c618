THE Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo Province executive plans to introduce a Division Two league that will feature teams from around the city. The league is aimed at accommodating and nurturing players that can’t make it into Division One and Super League teams. Provincial secretary Loviniah Bhebhe said they had initially intended to start the league in March, but their plans were thrown into disarray by the national lockdown prompted by Covid-19. “We had already received interest from a number of teams that wanted to part of this project. The idea is for the teams to fight for promotion into Division One and then the Super league,” said Bhebhe. She said they were targeting about 20 teams for the pilot project. According to the Sports and Recreation Commission, netball is among sports classified as high risk under its reopening category. Bhebhe said they had been using social media platforms to encourage their players to train safely alone to avoid contracting coronavirus. “We have been encouraging every athlete to stay at home and keep fit by doing home based exercises which we also share online. We continue to call on athletes to shy away from drugs,” said Bhebhe. Zina elected a provincial executive this year led by chairperson Ruth Hove and Joseph Nkomazana as deputy, with Cindy Mutero as vice-secretary, while Jabulani Manga is the fixtures secretary. Skhululiwe Mabhena and Prosper Mubaiwa are treasurer and organiser respectively, with Mthokozisi Gambu, Matriona Sibanda and lshumael Banda as committee members. – @innocentskizoe
