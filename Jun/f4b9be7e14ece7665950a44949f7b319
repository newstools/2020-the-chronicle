The Chronicle FIFA has written to the South African Football Association (Safa) to clarify the contract dilemma faced by George Maluleka and others in the Premier Soccer League. Safa wrote to the world football governing body asking it to elaborate further how to handle those employment contracts that are due to lapse on June 30 when the season would have ended under normal circumstances. Since the coronavirus pandemic halted football all over the world and around mid-March in the PSL specifically, Fifa compiled a document titled “Covid-19: Football Regulatory Issues” to address these questions and many more. Kaizer Chiefs’ Maluleka, for instance, is one of several players who are in this situation, although Amakhosi did announce three months ago that ‘Mido’ had rejected a contract extension and was joining Mamelodi Sundowns. “With regards to your inquiry on Fifa’s position on the status of contracts that are expiring at the end of June 2020, we wish to refer you to the section ‘expiring agreements and new agreements’ on page 4 of CFRI document, more specifically, to the guiding principles,” said Fifa in a letter responding to Safa acting CEO Tebogo Motlanthe. The world football governing body is clear on its stance: Where an agreement is due to expire at the end of the original end date of a season, such expiry be extended until the new end date of the season. In the event of overlapping seasons and/or registration periods, and unless all parties agree otherwise, priority be given to the former cub to complete their season with the original squad. Fifa then make it clear that a player has to consent to the new agreement, but there is no deal in place between Chiefs and Maluleka, while Sundowns are still to officially confirm signing him. – Soccer Laduma
