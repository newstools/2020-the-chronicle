THE Zimbabwe Karate Union (ZKU) took part in the Adidas Masterclass international virtual seminar hosted by world renowned instructors Junior Lefevre, Yukimitsu Hasegawa, Antonio Diaz, Cogita Arkania, Rene Smaal and Senegalese Fode Ndao. The day-long seminar included segments on modern kata (forms) training and kumite (fighting) drills. The kata segment focused on power projection balance and correct training methods amongst many other different technical areas. The kumite session was about the explosiveness of attacking movement, defensive exploitation for counterattacking and aerobic endurance. Participants from Zimbabwe included Tapiwa Nyikadzino, Emmanuel Mlauzi, Nicole Musarira, Vitoria Musarira, Nyasha Mutambanengwe and Dean Ramsey. “To say this was an eye opener for local karatekas would be an understatement. The few who managed to be part of the seminar were left with renewed vigour to excel and aspire to achieve the world standard as demonstrated. The only regret was that due to the short notice and more so the lockdown, only a few were able to attend the session,” said ZKU in a statement. “The ZKU extends its gratitude to the main sponsor and UK-based member of the ZKU management committee Sensei Alison Nyoni for giving back to the country by arranging the seminar and paying for the subscription. Going forward, beyond arranging for more virtual sessions, the ZKU will endeavour to bring some of these top coaches to the country to help in improving the standard of local karate.” Last month the ZKU organised a coaches online seminar conducted by World Karate Federation coaches. Next up is a two-day referees course to be conducted by WKF referee and UFAK Region South chief referee Sensei Llewelyn Rhoda just before the Japanese Ambassador’s tournament scheduled for shortly after karate is given the green light to resume activities. — @innocentskizoe
