The Chronicle Harare Bureau ACTRESS and radio personality Tinopona “Tin Tin” Katsande stands accused of ferrying to her close friend’s corpse her relatives without informing the police. The  incident occurred on Tuesday in Belvedere where Katsande allegedly hired a taxi to ferry the 45-year-old Rebecca Chinyerere’s body after she collapsed in a bathing room at the actress’ apartment. Tino could not be reached for comment since the day of the incident as her mobile phone was unreachable. The case has been reported at Avondale Police Station under RRB number 4381451. Rebecca will be buried tomorrow in Guruve. She survived by two sons. Family spokesperson Ishmael Chinyerere, uncle to the deceased, expressed dismay over Katsande’s decision to hire a taxi without informing police and relatives. “We know that death is there but the way Katsande failed to respect it left us with more questions than answers,” Ishmael told H-Metro. It is alleged that Katsande came to the late Rebecca’s house on Monday to pick her up. However brother to the late had ordered Rebecca not to leave the house since she was on medication. It is further alleged that Rebecca insisted that she would return the following morning since she was going with her two sons. On Tuesday evening, Tino is said to have brought home Rebecca’s body in a car with her two sons in the same car. “After she saw that her (Tino) friend had collapsed while naked, she went on to clothe her,” Ishmael further explained. “If we had known the cause we would say okay. She came and picked up my daughter only for her to come later with her dead body.”
