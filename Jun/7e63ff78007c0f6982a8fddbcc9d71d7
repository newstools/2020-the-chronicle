GOVERNMENT will on Wednesday release results of what caused the diarrhoea outbreak in Bulawayo’s Luveve suburb that has killed nine people and affected nearly 1 000 residents. Government last week set up a technical team to investigate the diarrhoea outbreak while deploying army doctors to complement the city’s health services department in treating patients. The Environmental Management Agency (Ema) is leading the technical committee. Residents have blamed the city’s water for the outbreak of the diarrhoea. Council established that the residents were suffering from gastrointestinal disease and is working towards establishing the cause. To contain the disease outbreak, on Monday last week, council initiated a door to door campaigns to identify diarrhoea patients and offered free medical treatment. Health experts had observed that patients were delaying seeking medical treatment. Council’s ambulances are ferrying critically ill patients to Mpilo Central Hospital free of charge. The local authority suspended Luveve suburb from the 144-hour weekly shedding exercise so that residents effectively deal with the outbreak. Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo on Friday said EMA led technical team will leave no stone unturned to establish what caused the diarrhoea outbreak. Acting Bulawayo Provincial Coordinator Mrs Khonzani Ncube yesterday said results of what caused the diarrhoea outbreak are out and will be announced today. “We have done all the necessary tests and results will be announced tomorrow. The results have been corroborated by various laboratories that were assigned to conduct the tests. We had water tests that needed to be done and they have been done,” said Mrs Ncube. The announcement of results could bring relief and closure to some of the Bulawayo families who lost their relatives and those affected by the diarrhoea outbreak. -@nqotshili
