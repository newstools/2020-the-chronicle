Bulilima-based actor-cum-gospel musician Sibangani Sibanda has his eyes set on opening a school of arts which is meant to unpack talent in the country’s remote areas. Popularly known as The Big Animal, Sibanda whose career dates back to the 1980s when he learnt arts at Mzilikazi Art Centre in Bulawayo said the arts school will also help keep young people off the streets. “In 1982, I learnt arts at Mzilikazi Art Centre for three years and during that period, I learnt a lot on the need for nurturing raw talent so as to keep the sector vibrant. “In that light, I’m working on opening a school for arts. It’ll be more of a recreation centre situated in Mbimba Village in Bulilima West constituency,” said The Big Animal. He said the centre is expected to teach, among other arts specifics, acting, dancing and singing. “The opening of the recreation centre will see the young ones getting extinct knowledge of acting, dancing and singing skills.” Having acted in South Africa’s top productions like Generations, Muvhango and short dramas, The Big Animal said he wants to impart his knowledge to up-and-coming artistes who want to make a breakthrough in the world of arts. In 2010, The Big Animal landed a role in Generations as Speros, a bodyguard. In Isidingo, he featured as a prisoner while in After 9, a drama series he acted as Chana’s Uncle. Other than acting, he is a gospel artiste who through his Impiyosindiso Group, has nine albums. “I’ve nine traditional gospel albums where I sing in different languages that include Shona, Kalanga, Sotho, Tonga, Ndebele and Chewa,” The Big Animal said. Other than arts, the group also does humanitarian work. “As a group, we also help people who are suffering or sick people through doing shows and giving them the proceeds to assist in whatever they need. Since we’re not hosting shows currently, we’re engaging the corporate world to jump on board and assist.” — @mthabisi_mthire.
