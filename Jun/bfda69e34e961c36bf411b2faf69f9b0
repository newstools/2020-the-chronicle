CHESS Mates Academy is ready for the post Covid-19 period and is in the process of acquiring personal protective equipment (PPE) for its use. According to Chess Mates Academy director Priscah Sibanda, they are working flat out to ensure players make a safe return to the sport. “Just like everyone else we are also preparing for post Covid-19 by placing practical measures in place for the safe return of players to playing. “We are acquiring necessary Covid-19 equipment like gloves, masks, non-contact thermometers, sanitisers and also making sure that we have clean running water for washing of hands. “We will be requesting our coaches and players to undergo tests before coming into contact for games. After all this is done we will stand guided by the Government through the Health Ministry, but we are looking forward to returning to playing and for now we will continue playing our games online,” she said. As part of efforts to diversify sporting disciplines in schools the National Association of Secondary Heads and National Association of Primary School Heads have included chess and other minority sports in the main school curriculum. Sibanda believes synergies between Chess Mates Academy and schools will present life-changing opportunities to players. “We remain guided by what health authorities and the Government have laid out in order to protect the well-being of our players and in so doing help preserve life. “That is why we would want to caution players, particularly learners, to practise safety measures.” — @innocentskizoe
