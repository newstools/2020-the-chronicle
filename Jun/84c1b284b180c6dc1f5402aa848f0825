THE desire to grow their brand beyond the country’s borders has seen trendsetting Premier Soccer League side Bulawayo Chiefs becoming the first local team to set up an online shop to sell its merchandise. Chiefs, who are referred to as local football’s Twitter Kings due to their huge social media following and catchy tweets, launched the online shop on Tuesday night. The shop will service Chiefs’ followers around the world. Chiefs were the first club to have its Twitter handle verified two years ago and have outpaced the league’s old guards in using digital media platforms for effective communication and outreach. Club spokesperson Thulani “Javas” Sibanda said the clubs’ merchandise on offer includes tracksuits, sweaters, hats, masks, socks, shorts, T-shirts and official replicas. “We have always endevoured to excell in our quest to grow our brand as a professional team hence the move to avail merchandise to all our fans, followers, sympathisers and sports lovers around the country and beyond. “We have the items in our shop in Bulawayo and we can courier to our buyers around the country. Our target market is anyone in the country who associates with football or sport in general and anyone who looks beyond a badge and support footbal,” Sibanda said. For the overseas market, the online store website directs buyers to the Chiefs’ kit sponsor Leyburn Sports’ website. The Sports Leaders Institute of Zimbabwe (Sliz) earlier this year challenged sporting organisations, particularly football clubs to use the Covid-19 break to find other ways of generating revenue away from the field of play. They urged local clubs to embrace new technologies and leave a footprint on the digital platforms. Chiefs seem determined to grow their membership and their social media timelines are among the most active on the domestic front. — @ZililoR
