#WeWrite, an online short story competition is set to announce winners of the programme on Wednesday evening after submission of stories closed last week. The competition which is being organised by the Bulawayo Junior City Council will see winners being announced on WhatsApp. Child President, Mukudzeishe Madzivire who is a pupil at Bulawayo’s Christian Brothers College (CBC) said: “On July 1, we’re going to have an online prize giving ceremony on WhatsApp because Zoom was unfriendly to some of the students. “About 36 students in the senior category participated in the competition. The junior category only had three participants so we’re not going to award second and third place,” he said. The online ceremony will see number one in junior division walk away with ZW$800, while top three in the seniors division will take home cash prizes of ZW$1 500, ZW$1 000 and ZW$500. The event will be presided by Zimbabwe Youth Council (ZYC) head of business development, data and research Sungano Chisina and 4-H Zimbabwe Foundation director John Muchenje. Madzivire said shortlisted entries will be published in a booklet in order to appreciate the linguistic skills of the pupils. @mthabisi-mthire
