MORE than 300 youths in Matabeleland North have applied for the $17 million Covid-19 relief grant set aside by Government to assist youths. Government, through the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation set up the relief fund to support youth-led businesses and associations. The fund is accessible to registered youth entrepreneurs and associations affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The applicants can get up to $5 000 and Matabeleland North was allocated $1,3 million. To benefit one should have an existing and formally registered business, been operating for six months before the start of the lockdown on March 30, produce bank statements dating back to six months of the same period. Being a largely rural province, Matabeleland North initially had only six applicants who had provided all the required documents. The number had by yesterday risen to about 300 following awareness campaigns conducted by various stakeholders and the relaxation of the requrements for one to qualify. About 80 of them are expected to start receiving the money this week after getting confirmation that their applications had been approved. Zanu-PF Matabeleland North Youth League chairperson, Cde Tamuka Nyoni confirmed that about 80 youths will be receiving the funds this week while the remainder had been asked to provide outstanding documents. “We would like to thank the Youth Ministry for coming to Matabeleland North and availing the grant as this will boost household incomes. We also thank President Mnangagwa who listened to the pleas from rural youths to relax requirements for one to qualify. We can now approach councillors and headmen and get our affidavits signed and these are now part of the required documents,” said Cde Nyoni. He implored Government to further relax requirements for people living with disabilities. “We also appeal to the Ministry to continue availing more funds and encourage our fellow peers to use the funds wisely. There should be separate criteria when it comes to people living with disabilities.We need to see more of them benefitting from this grant,” said Cde Nyoni. Ms Soneni Ncube, a flea market vendor in Lupane is one of those that have applied for the fund. <img class="wp-image-501873 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Ms-Soneni-Ncube-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Ms-Soneni-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Ms-Soneni-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Soneni Ncube “I applied and I am waiting for a response. The lockdown has left us with nothing and we pin our hopes on this fund to give us seed capital to restock and start afresh. Government should also relax the daily clock register requirement because rural youths are not used to that. There is also need to ensure the disabled benefit from this grant,” she said. Mr Trynos Taruvinga, who is chairperson of Chinotimba Flea Market in Victoria Falls said not a single member had his or her application approved. Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Deputy Minister Tino Machakaire last Saturday encouraged youths at an awareness meeting in Lupane to apply for the fund saying Government had allowed traditional leaders and councillors to certify their documents. Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Richard Moyo also noted with concern the challenges faced by rural youths saying this was the cause for low uptake. — @ncubeleon
