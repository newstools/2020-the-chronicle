CLEMENCY Sibanda (69) will not only be remembered for his contagious smile, but also for donating a whopping 46 litres blood in his lifetime which saved 279 lives. According to the National Blood Service Zimbabwe (NBSZ), a pint of blood which measures 500ml can save three lives. The staunch blood donor from Famona suburb in Bulawayo died on Sunday of heart attack. He met his death a month after donating his 93rd pint of blood, a record. He died serving as a committee member for the NBSZ Bulawayo branch where he led by example and recruited many towards the noble cause. While Zimbabwe joined the rest of the world in commemorating World Blood Donor Day last Sunday, the Sibanda family learnt of the passing of their father who was the only blood donor in the family. He was buried at Mvutsha Cemetery on Thursday. Chronicle caught up with his eldest daughter Ms Abigail Sibanda who described her father as an ever-smiling friend. <img class="wp-image-501156 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Abigail-Sibanda-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Abigail-Sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Abigail-Sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Abigail Sibanda “My father was a well-known blood donor who never missed out on any event to do with donating because he had a big heart. “He loved serving and helping people which explains why he managed to dedicate his live to bettering the lives of his family and even unknown people,” said Ms Sibanda. “We would jog together every morning and he never tired to keep me smiling, a mannerism which he was well known for.” Ms Sibanda said though her father was a regular blood donor, none of his family members were donors. “He was very passionate about donating blood and though we could not emulate that we are proud because he taught us to be always helpful, humble and thoughtful even to total strangers. These lessons will forever be in our memory,” added Ms Sibanda. Besides being part of the NBSZ Bulawayo committee, Sibanda had also dedicated his life to recruiting more blood donors for the organisation. According to the NBSZ regional marketing manager Mr Sifundo Ngwenya, Sibanda will be remembered for his smile and professionalism which helped the organisation get more donations. <img class="wp-image-501150 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Mr-Sifundo-Ngwenya-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Mr-Sifundo-Ngwenya.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Mr-Sifundo-Ngwenya-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Sifundo Ngwenya “He was a Bulawayo committee member for blood donations and had donated 93 pints of blood in his lifetime.
