South African television soapie Muvhango will halt production until further notice because of a Covid-19 scare after some crew members were exposed to the deadly virus. The SABC 2 soapie that has a huge following in Zimbabwe has been on the screens for over 20 years. According to a statement from the production house, Word of Mouth Pictures, there were some employees that were exposed to Covid-19 and as a precautionary measure, they are halting production. “Recently, we were alerted of a number of cases where some of our employees were exposed to Covid-19. All cases reported to the company have been thoroughly investigated and doctors called in to do tests. While awaiting for all outstanding results, Word Of Mouth Pictures will halt production of Muvhango until further notice,” read the statement. The statement said the production house has been adhering to strict safety protocols while on set. For now though, people can continue to watch Muvhango everyday at 9PM on SABC 2. This halt in production by Muvhango comes after three popular South African weekday soapies shut down production due to positive cases of Covid-19 on set. 7de Laan (SABC 2), Rhythm City (e.tv), and Scandal! (e.tv) have had to halt production. All three series are filmed at Sasani Studios in Highlands North, Johannesburg. These three shows are just the latest in a string of SA productions that have had to stop filming due to the virus.
