In the first quarter trading update for the period ended March 31, 2020, the group said it was on course to achieve its performance targets for the year. “However, the unexpected outbreak of the Covid-19 global pandemic in the last part of the quarter with its negative impact on business performance created a material uncertainty that would require extensive business re-strategising for survival,” it said. Going forward, ZHL noted that its resilience and that of the Southern African region shall be tested in the second half of the year. “ZHL shall lean heavily on its financial strength buttressed by its size-able property portfolio to weather the storm and preserve shareholder value. “The strategic focus shall be responding to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and implementing short-term survival strategies including balance sheet preservation and cost control,” it said.
