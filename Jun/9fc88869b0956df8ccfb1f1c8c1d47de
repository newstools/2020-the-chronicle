The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter While others miss going out clubbing, videographer Vusa Blaqs who has been scooping awards for the past couple of years, yesterday said he simply misses taking to the stage to receive awards and give speeches. The multi-award-winning videographer is one man who knows his worth and is very confident of it. With his Umsebenzi ka Blaqs productions, Vusa has expressed his creativity on most of Jah Prayzah’s music videos, something which has seen him scoop award after award. Knowing his worth and showing confidence of his works, Vusa yesterday posted: “Some people miss going out and clubbing. I miss making speeches at the awards,” on his Facebook page somehow suggesting that he was confident of winning awards with his recent works. <img class="size-full wp-image-501833" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Vusa-Blaqs2.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="2048" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Vusa-Blaqs2.jpg 1536w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Vusa-Blaqs2-270x360.jpg 270w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Vusa-Blaqs2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Vusa-Blaqs2-510x680.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /> Vusa blaqs with Aleck Macheso and Freeman And indeed, Blaqs may be in line to win an award/awards if the viewership numbers of his latest videos are anything to go by. Chief among them is Mukwasha by Jah Prayzah that was released last month and has 1.8 million views closely followed by Donhodzo which has 1.1 million views. The videos have been commended by many who have hailed Blaqs for his creativity. Some went on to say Blaqs needs to be appreciated more as he is a gem. “But guys, we need to appreciate Blaqs. Mmm visuals are on point,” commented one Siphosenkosi on the Mukwasha video on YouTube.
