GWERU City Council yesterday signed two contracts with two construction companies worth about US$6 million for the construction of four smart city markets and travel ports. The city took advantage of the lockdown to clean the city, which had seen vendors erecting illegal structures on pavements and other undesignated places. The council has also decongested the Central Business District as directed by Cabinet. Council invited private companies to partner it to implement its smart city concept and two companies, Bentach Resources and Casas Properties Investments came forward. Addressing councillors, management and Bentach Resources and Casas Properties Investments officials during the contracts signing ceremony, Mayor, Councillor Josiah Makombe said the project was meant to provide modern facilities for vendors and travellers. The markets and travel ports, Clr Makombe said, will accommodate more than 4 000 people. “Bentach Resources will renovate Kudzanayi long distance bus terminus while Casas Properties Investments will renovate Kombayi vegetable wholesale market, Wimpy and Mtapa markets,” he said. Clr Makombe said the deal which is worth US$6 million, is a win win situation for Gweru City Council and the two companies. He said the companies have been given four months to complete work and he was confident they will meet the target.
