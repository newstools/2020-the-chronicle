LUPANE Women’s Centre has gained recognition as one of the key export earners in Matabeleland North Province through its vibrant art and craft products. The country’s trade and development agency, ZimTrade, has commended the hard work by Lupane women and revealed that plans were underway to establish an export cluster in Matabeleland North to leverage on such community production models. The centre exports a wide range of art and craft products to countries in the region such as South Africa, Zambia and Mozambique as well as abroad to Canada, United States of America, Holland and Germany. Posting on its official Twitter handle, ZimTrade said: “The Lupane Women’s Centre has been ensuring sustenance of women’s livelihoods through arts and crafts since 1995. Currently they work with more than 400 women in Lupane. “We are working to establish an Export Cluster in Matabeleland North that will leverage on their skills and potential.” Matabeleland North province is endowed with natural resources such as coal-bed methane gas, gold, coal, timber, wildlife and massive water bodies making the region suitable for irrigation. ZimTrade has in the past done surveys in different global markets, which indicate that art and craft products could significantly boost Zimbabwe’s export earnings.
