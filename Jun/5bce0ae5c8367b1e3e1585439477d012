GOSPEL musician Vusumuzi Mangena has released a song, Sabela that is premised on the book of Revelations (Chapter 3, Verse 20) saying people should take heed of God’s calling. The track which he released at the weekend is a precursor to a yet-to-be-named album that he will release at the end of the year. The worship song reminds people that they are living in the last days. “The song reminds us to do some self-introspection of our lives, to heed the call to live lives that are worthy of Him. We shouldn’t forget that a time is coming when we will be called and we have to answer for our life’s actions and choices,” said Mangena. “My inspiration for the track is summarised by Revelations 3 verse 20 which reads Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any man hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me.” Mangena said people have been focused on the wrong things. “We are living in the last days where both believers and non-believers are very much in their own things of life, yet the Second Coming is so imminent. However, it seems we have forgotten we are focused on other things. “So on Sabela, I sing about how the door is still open for people to do the right thing, heed the call of Christ,” said Mangena. “The response from the time the song came out has been both humbling and overwhelming. I cannot say thank you enough to those who have listened to it thus far,” said Mangena. — @bonganinkunzi
