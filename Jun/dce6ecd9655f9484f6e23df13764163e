TWENTY-TWO candidates have been nominated to fill up Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) vacancies following retirement of four commissioners last month. ZHRC commissioners’ Dr Ellen Sithole, Dr Joseph Kurebwa, Mr Japhet Ndabeni-Ncube and Ms Kwanele Jirira retired last month at the end of their respective terms. This caused the ZHRC to stop conducting its duties as the remaining commissioners did not constitute a quorum after Comm Carrol Khombe resigned in 2018. Parliament has moved in to bring normalcy in ZHRC with prospective candidates set to be interviewed on Friday. In a statement, Parliament’s Committee on Standing Rules and Orders (CSRO) on Sunday announced 22 nominees from 32 candidates that had signaled intentions to fill up the vacant positions. Among the nominated 22, is Professor Philani Moyo, Dr Madlenkosi Moyo, Dr Ernest Dube, Dr Admark Moyo, Dr Catherine Muchechetere, Dr Mclarence Mandaza, Mr Stanley Moyo, Mrs Dorothy Moyo, Ngwenya among others. “The CSRO was advised of the four vacancies in the said commission which were going to occur on the expiry of their term of office, in line with the aforesaid mandate, an advertisement was placed in the national newspaper on the 14th February 2020 requesting the public to nominate persons for possible appointment with a view to filling the said vacant posts.
