THE Covid-19 lockdown has delayed debuts for Young Fling Flying Stars Academy (YFSSA) graduates Shaine Ngwenya, Jacob Mloyi and Addlight Zvembire in the Zifa Southern Region Division One league. Ngwenya (20) and Mloyi (18) signed for former Premier Soccer League outfit Hwange FC while Zvembire (19) joined Arenel from the academy and the three are anxious to kick the ball in a new and challenging environment. “It’s unfortunate that Covid-19 has delayed this year’s football action. After registering for their Southern Region Division One teams early this year, our boys wanted to hit the ground running. They are anxiously waiting for those Division One debuts and they want to shine. However, we have been continuously telling them to remain focused,” said YFSSA founder Collen Nyambiya. Last year, the academy, which caters for players between the ages of five and 20 years, held trials in Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South provinces scouting for young talent. Businessman Peter Mubi recently partnered with YFSSA and there’re plans to put up a camping house for the Under-20 boys stay ahead of matches. The academy’s Under-18 team plays in the Zifa Bulawayo Under-20 League while its Under-14-team finished fifth in its league and hope for a higher finish when matches eventually start after the lockdown. — @FungaiMuderere
