LOGISTICS companies are slowly shifting focus to servicing the domestic sector in response to slowdown in business due to Covid-19 induced lockdowns globally. Under normal circumstances most logistics companies prefer facilitating transportation of goods from overseas by road, air or shipping. Most of the goods are imported from countries that include China, United Kingdom, United States of America, Dubai and distributed in the region via South Africa and other countries. Chinese-based logistics company Bheksaz Shalom Solutions chief executive officer, Mr Bhekoluhle Dube, said the pandemic has affected their earnings as borders are closed and business is low. “International transportation of goods at the present moment is low as most of the goods are Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), which are being prioritised by individuals and companies. “Covid-19 has affected us so much as prices of airlines doubled and this has forced prices of shipping to rise,” said Mr Dube. In that light, he said they have taken advantage of the inter-city travel ban to transport goods countrywide. “Most people rely on intercity buses to send their parcels but buses have been banned. We will be operating in Bulawayo, Gweru, Kwekwe, Kadoma, Chegutu and Harare,” said Mr Dube. Zimbabwean based logistics service provider Member Investments owner Mr Bulisani Tshuma said the loss of earnings during the lockdown by the logistics company should serve as an eye opener to budget for losses in future. Mr Tshuma said the affected logistics companies should shift focus to transporting goods locally such as mealie-meal and other basics. — @mthabisi_mthire.
