The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) has congratulated Amapiano queen, Sha Sha for scooping the Viewer’s Choice: Best New International Act Award at the 20th BET Awards saying her achievement has served as an endorsement of the Zimbabwean and African arts. NACZ director Nicholas Moyo in congratulating Sha Sha said the award which comes on the backdrop of the world celebrating the mbira through Google during the recent Culture Week celebrations, proved that local artistes have what it takes to promote the country. “This award is an endorsement on the growth and development of the arts sector in Zimbabwe and Africa at large, coming so soon after the Zimbabwean mbira was recently celebrated by global technology firm Google. “Such global recognition of Zimbabwe arts and culture is testimony that the sector has the potential to contribute significantly to the development of the country,” said Moyo. He said as NACZ, they attribute Sha Sha’s success to her great talent whose works speak for themselves. “As NACZ, this success did not come as a surprise to the council as we are aware of the amount of hard work and dedication that she has put in her artistic works and we feel that this award is in recognition of her talent and amazing vocal ability. “Any good work will speak for itself, the world has made a determination and we acknowledge the endorsement,” said Moyo. He added that the award will open more doors for Sha Sha. “We truly believe that this award is just the beginning of many such successes in Sha Sha’s career and we wish her all the very best for her future endeavours. We also call upon other creatives in various sectors to take encouragement from this success to continue with their creative work despite the various lockdown conditions that have had to be imposed by the government to limit the spread of the Covid-19 disease.”
