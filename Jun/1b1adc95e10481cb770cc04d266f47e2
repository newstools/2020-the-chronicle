BULAWAYO Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Manuel Mpofu remains confident that the province will host the Technical Officials Education and Certification System (TOECS) Level 1 course that was suspended following outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. The international course was initially scheduled for April at White City Stadium. “We were supposed to host the TOECS Level 1 course in April, but due to Covid it’s still suspended till intercity movement is allowed because it involves participants from other provinces,” said Mpofu. Objectives of the TOECS course are to provide participants with theoretical and practical training to make them competent to officiate at local, regional and international competitions held in their countries. Athletics is among sports that have been declared less risky by the Government and has been given the green light to resume, although relays and field events remain suspended. Bab expects to fully resume activities in August with the hosting of a track event at White City Stadium. The association has already begun work to ensure a safe return of athletes to the track. — @innocentskizoe
