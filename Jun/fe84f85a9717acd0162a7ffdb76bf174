THE 2020 edition of the annual PPC Matopos Ultra Marathon has been cancelled as the country is on an indefinite national lockdown due to outbreak of Covid-19. The event which had initially been scheduled for April 4, was postponed after the Government announced a ban on public gatherings and sports due to Covid-19. “We would like to advise PPC Matopos Marathon 2020 runners and the public at large that the next edition of the race will now take place in 2021 on a date to be advised. This postponement has been necessitated by the ongoing measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic,” read a statement from the organisers. Runners that had already registered and paid will be eligible to participate in the 2021 edition with no additional payment required. The PPC Matopos Marathon, which includes the 33-miler (53km), 21km, 10km and 5km fun run, joins several other sporting events that have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Close to 1 000 people had already registered for the Matopos Marathon online. The race usually attracts up to 3 000 runners. Another crowd puller, the annual Old Mutual Nkulumane Half Marathon, which is held in early May was also affected by the pandemic. Last year’s 53km POC Matopos Marathon was won by Black Rhinos runner Andrew Chimbidzikai in a time of 3 hours 12 minutes 22 seconds. Nedbank’s Chiedza Chokore clocked 3 hours 57 minutes 17 seconds to take the women’s gong. — @FungaiMuderere.
