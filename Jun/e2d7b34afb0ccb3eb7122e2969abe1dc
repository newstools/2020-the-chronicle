FROM Ascot in Bulawayo and Jahunda township in Gwanda, artistes from the region yesterday hosted online shows where they delivered top-drawer performances. In the city, a mixed genre affair engulfed as afro-pop musician Mzoe 7, afro-house trio Djembe Monks, gospel musician Vuyo Brown and afro-soul musician Thandy Dhlana gave it their whole at an event dubbed #UN75 Virtual concert. Streamed live on the Cite Facebook page, the event was watched by over 6 000 people. Vuyo Brown opened the show and gave flesh to her Thula Wazi track which is topping radio charts. She was followed by Mzoe 7 who lit up the comments section after the performance of his Amapiano track, Asambeni. Thandy Dhlana who was backed by proficient group Ngoma iNgoma gave people the much-needed soulful touch. Djembe Monks alongside Mzoe 7 also worked wonders on stage. As this was happening, Gwanda artistes were also at it as many made their debut appearances online during the commemorations of the Day of the African Child. Taking note that many of them were performing for the first time for a virtual audience, the artistes who included Bolamba Culture Birds, GDA Fire, Zhezhingtons, Bry, Khoi Khoi, Skollah, Kadder really did great although just less than 200 people watched the live stream. Having slowly gelled to online shows, the ball is now in the courts for the artistes to hunt for sponsors and ensure their talent does not go to waste. @mthabisi_mthire
