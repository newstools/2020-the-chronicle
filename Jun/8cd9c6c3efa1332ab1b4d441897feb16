The Chronicle With an hour left before BET Awards voting platforms for the Viewers’ Choice: Best New International Act category close, question is have you voted for fellow Zimbabwean, Amapiano queen Sha Sha? South Africa-based Sha Sha who is behind the Tender Love hit is up against Rema (Nigeria) Celeste (UK), Young T & Bugsey (UK), Hatik (France) and Stacy (France) and has been facing very stiff competition from Rema. The deadline for voting on Instagram and the BET website is 5PM CAT today. The 20th BET Awards are to take place on June 28 with the ceremony set to celebrate achievements in entertainment and honour music, sports, television and movie personalites. The awards ceremony will be held virtually due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns and will be simulcasted via CBS. Leading the pack of nominees are Drake, Roddy Ricch and Megan Thee Stallion. Drake scored six nods, with Ricch and Stallion following with five. After today, locals will have to wait for June 28 to see if their girl will scoop the award. But even if she does not, most have said she is already a winner because just the recognition on its own is a win. “A nomination is a win in itself and this being the first BER nomination for Zimbabwe, we thank you for doing great for the entire industry. Keep pushing,” Jah Prayzah posted on Sha Sha’s Twitter timeline as he congratulated her for the nomination earlier in the week.
