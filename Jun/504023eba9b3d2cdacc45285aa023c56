A 53-YEAR-OLD Filabusi man has been ordered to pay a $3 000 fine after he stabbed his young brother with a knife in the stomach following a misunderstanding while discussing family issues. Alfred Moyo from Shamba area was convicted on his own plea of guilty to assault by Gwanda regional magistrate Mrs Sibonginkosi Mhlanga. He was ordered to have paid $3 000 fine by June 30 or risk being jailed for six months. Moyo was initially charged with attempted murder which was later altered to assault due to the level of injuries which were sustained by the complainant. Prosecuting Mr Khumbulani Nyoni said Moyo and his brother Mr Aleck Moyo (44) were discussing family issues when they had a misunderstanding. The accused person pulled out an okapi knife and stabbed his brother on the stomach. “On 2 March at around 6PM Alfred and Aleck were drinking beer at Alfred’s home discussing family issues. A misunderstanding ensued between them and Alfred went into his bedroom and came out with a stick and struck his brother three times on the back,” he said. “The complainant managed to snatch the stick from Alfred and hit him back. Alfred retrieved an okapi knife from his pocket which he used to stab the complainant on the stomach. Aleck was assisted by his nephew who escorted him to the police station to file a report leading to the arrest of the accused person.” In mitigation, Moyo said he attacked the complainant in self-defense after he was attacked first. He said his brother first punched him and in anger, he took a stick and used it to hit back. Moyo said the complainant snatched the stick from him and began assaulting him and that is when he panicked and pulled out the knife. “I panicked Your Worship and pulled out the knife when Aleck kept continuously hitting me with the stick as I thought he would hurt me. It wasn’t my intention to hurt him as I was just acting out of self-defense,” he said. @DubeMatutu
