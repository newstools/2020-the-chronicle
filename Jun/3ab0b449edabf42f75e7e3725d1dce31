THE country’s largest cement products manufactuerer, Portland Cement (PPC) Zimbabwe, today launched a new product range as the firm seeks to address the challenges of cheap and substandard cement imports flooding the local market. The local cement industry has appealed for protection from imported cement, which is threatening the viability of local producers. Given the significant role that the cement sector plays, other regional countries have adopted tariff measures to protect their cement industries from imports, but Zimbabwe remains an open market. Zimbabwe attracts imported cement due to high prices of its locally produced cement, which has seen other countries taking advantage of the price discrepancy to export their excess to the country. PPC Zimbabwe managing director, Mr Kelibone Masiyane, announced today the launch of the company’s latest product range called the SURERANGE, which is made up of six exceptional products namely: Surewall, Surebuild, Surecem, Surecast, Sureroad and Suretech. The products are part of the company’s threefold strategy aimed at caring for the customers, caring for the environment and to be the cement industry’s technology leader.
