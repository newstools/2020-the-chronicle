PLUMTREE-based tribal music drummer Mthulisi Ndlovu feels that staying in a small town has stunted his growth, but he wants to change that by reinventing himself. Using the stage name Que, the artiste who hails from rural Empandeni plays the drum to resonate a tribal sound similar to that of Djembe Monks. The 31 year-old, despite being in the game for quite a while, has few achievements, something he said has been influenced by lack of sponsorship in small towns. However, the coming of the lockdown, Que, also a DJ, said has given him time to reflect on his career. Through reflecting, he has decided to perfect his art and make it more appealing. “The lockdown has been a time for me to work on my talent and make sure that I play the drum in a way befitting to land gigs nationally. As I focus more on tribal music, I’m mastering my mixtapes daily so as keep up with the new sounds and songs,” Que said. He said he has had to shift from one arts genre to the other searching for his ideal one. “I started doing arts at Dingumuzi Primary in 1996 where I was into traditional dramas, singing, dancing, acting and drumming up to secondary school. “I then chose to focus on playing marimba and was part of the school’s drama club where we, at one time, took part at the national school arts competitions that were held at Chipawo.” “Since then, I tried to push an arts career but failed to do so successfully as it was so hard for me to find other groups I could work with in Plumtree. Because of distance, I also couldn’t partner with those in places like Bulawayo,” he said. As such, he had to go it alone, which is how he started playing drums. “As an artiste, it’s my wish to grow, but I don’t have support and adequate equipment. As someone who’s struggled in the arts sector, it’s also my wish to assist up-and-coming artistes who could in a similar predicament like mine,” said Que. – @mthabisi_mthire.
