MASIYE Netball League founder Joseph Nkomazana says they are struggling to keep players motivated during this Covid-19 lockdown. The main aim of the social league is to promote and protect the girl child from the risk of HIV and Aids, and drug abuse. “Our project has been greatly affected by the pandemic. While the whole sporting fraternity has been affected, I feel it’s even worse for our community social netball teams. We are struggling to even help our girls with anything because we do not have sponsors. We are a league with 13 teams and that is a large number of girls who need support during this period, be it financially or mentally. “As it stands, players are inactive, which can be stressing. Even though they were not remunerated for playing in these games, the girls had something to do which is the whole idea of the league. We are talking of a girl child and it’s a little bit tricky to motivate them besides telling them to be patient until this lockdown is over,” said Nkomazana. Before sporting activities were suspended in March, the Masiye League teams had played only one round of games. Teams in the league include Jess Academy, Flying Eagles, Royal Montlers, Sizinda Queens, Mighty Queens, Swallows, Expandables, Seven Stars, Young Queens, Lobengula Leopards, East Rovers, Caaz and New Vision. @innocentskizoe
