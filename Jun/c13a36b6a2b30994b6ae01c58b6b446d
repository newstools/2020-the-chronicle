The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Fans who watched last night’s Bulawayo LIVE sessions virtual gig have hailed the concept and entertainment value. The one hour-long session was headlined by top Bulawayo wheel spinners, DJ Prince Eskhosini and Slimzar wa Afrika and was co-hosted on Fokus Magazine, Bulawayo Unlocked and Ingwebu Breweries Facebook pages. DJ Prince Eskhosini kicked off the session with hard hitting Amapiano mixes ranging from top charting South African tunes fused with the Bulawayo banging tracks from Skaiva and Hwabaraty among others. Slimzar wa Afrika, who is a member of the trio Djembe Monks took over on the half hour mark to finish off the exciting session with a different tone, taking a deeper and more tribal house approach. Commenting on the live show, music promoter Tawanda Carlito Gochera who is behind the Kadoma Music Awards said: “This is what we want to see happening everywhere. We can’t have one city doing the virtual gigs, let’s all participate in these trending platforms during Covid-19 and the indefinite lockdown. “I was impressed by the DJs and also the arrangement of the whole show. Bulawayo really brought the club experience into our living rooms.” Deniss Phiri who was watching from Namibia said the show took him back home. “Watching my favourite DJs from back home was nostalgic. We need more of these online shows so that we keep connected to our home town, well done Bulawayo,” he said. The event which has become a weekly programme will return next Thursday and organisers have promised a different feel. “We are happy with what we’ve been doing so far and what we managed to pull off last night despite the technical glitches at some point. “The viewership numbers are swiftly trickling in and with more consistency, we will get there. The DJs we have brought in these past two weeks have been nothing but impressive and more are yet to come,” said Dalu Van Vodloza, one of the event organisers. @mthabisi_mthire
