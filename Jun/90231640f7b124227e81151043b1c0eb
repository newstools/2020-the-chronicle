The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA has threatened the quartet of Bulawayo province vice chairman Allan Mpofu and his three members of the board with unspecified action if they don’t tender their resignation letters by mid day tomorrow. The threats were issued by the association’s chief executive officer Joseph Mamutse via a letter addressed to Mpofu yesterday. Mpofu, Takawira Madza, Charles Ndlovu and Otrick Siziba protested heavily last week and said they will step down following  the shock reinstatement of provincial chairman Francis Ntutha by the Zifa national executive committee with sources saying that decision was taken after a resolution by some councillors who attended a still unclear meeting in Kwekwe whose agenda also remains a mystery. Kindly be advised that your official letters for resignation should be submitted on or before 1200 hours on June 22, 2020, failure of which necessary action will be taken against you,” wrote the Zifa head of secretariat on his letter to Mpofu.
