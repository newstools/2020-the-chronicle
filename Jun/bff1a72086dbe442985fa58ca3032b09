Zifa last week filed a false executive committee resolution empowering the association to apply for condonation on their ongoing battle with vice president Gift Banda as the association continues to embarrass itself on the case. The attached resolution was during the Phillip Chiyangwa era in 2017 when the board resolved to apply for condonation on their case with the Sheriff of the High Court on the attachment of Zifa property. The gaffe forced Zifa to make a hasty withdrawal of the application. “We refer to the above, we advise that we erroneously attached the wrong Annexure A to the application for condonation. We accordingly withdraw the application filed on the 8th instant as per the notice of withdrawal hereto attached. Be pleased to take notice that the applicant withdraws this matter and tender the wasted costs. We apologise for the inconvenience caused,” reads the withdrawal notice from the Zifa lawyers Ngarava, Moyo and Chikono. In an effort to cover face, the association then attached another executive committee resolution but Banda’s legal team are dismissing it as a legal nullity because their client was not in attendance at the so called meeting. “Remember Banda was cleared by the Appeals Committee on June 2 and it meant whatever executive committee meeting that was called after, he too was supposed to be in attendance but he was not at this June 6 meeting and there was no 21-day notice of a full executive committee meeting so to us that resolution is not binding at all,” said Banda’s lawyer Munyaradzi Nzarayapenga of Dube-Banda, Nzarayapenga and Partners.
