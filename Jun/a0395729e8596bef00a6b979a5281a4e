Fast rising group, Ngoma Ingoma alongside up-and-coming afro pop/house musician Natalie ‘Nate’ Manzungu will be headlining Fusion Media Group’s (FMG) virtual show tonight. Dubbed the Lockdown party, the show which is in its seventh edition will take place at the FMG studios and will be shown on the FMG Facebook page from 8pm. A brainchild of FMG founder Tatenda “MK” Mnkandla and Ngoma Ingoma bass guitarist Blessing Stot, the event which is being staged weekly to promote artistes from Bulawayo, has been growing with each week. He said Ngoma Ingoma, a group well known for its Amalobolo hit, had been invited due to public demand. “Following a number of requests from fans to have Ngoma Ingoma on our sessions, we’re glad to say that we’ve managed to get them on board. They’ll be doing an hour long session. “Nate came through as a replacement for Cal Vin and it’s going to be a different vibe for her, as she’ll be performing with a high profile group. Her future seems so bright because she is ready to work and create content unlike some artists who aren’t putting themselves out there,” MK said. As one of the forefront runners in introducing virtual shows in Bulawayo, MK said they are pleased with how artistes are adapting to the new normal.
