The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent NATIONAL Arts Merit Awards (Nama) 2020 Outstanding Artist in the Diaspora, Vusa Mkhaya has re-launched his 10-track album, formerly Umanyayatha now Umanyanyatha – Songs of the Soul of Zimbabwe. The album was re-launched today under Canada’s internationally acclaimed music label Naxos Records and has three new tracks. It consists of tracks released in 2016, Mayibabo, Manyanyatha, Lizobuya, Lalela, Siyeza, Uthando, Bayakhala, Naisiyai, Abalalanga and Zhiya while the new tracks are Ubuntu, Africa and Kudala. Speaking from his base in Vienna, Austria, Mkhaya said people were able to pre-order the album on iTunes and Amazon and he is happy with the support the album has received thus far. Listening to the new tracks one is driven back to his African roots and Mkhaya hit the right chord through the song Africa which has a rhythmic buoyancy that carries messages of hope and unity for the people in this devastating time where the deadly virus has taken over the world. On track Ubuntu, one is reminded not to forsake their roots with Mkhaya singing: “I am who I am because of my history and background. We must always be proud of who we are, where we come from.” As most people are spending their time at home because of the lockdown, the track Uthando is one that can cheer them up with its percussion and guitar lending a summery vibe to soft, breezy vocals. @mthabisi_mthire
