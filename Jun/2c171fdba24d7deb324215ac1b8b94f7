Fast-rising Gwanda duo, GDA Fire, has roped in talented female artiste Shalah (real name Belinda Nyathi) as part of a revamping exercise. Previously, the House/Afro Soul outfit was made up of male artistes, Mr Gibbonz and Ronnie B. Explaining the latest addition, the duo said it came after introspection during the lockdown as they are eyeing to grow their brand when the lockdown ends. Speaking from his base in Gwanda, Mr Gibbonz said the lockdown made them reflect as a group and think of ways of attracting more crowds. “As a group, the pandemic has left us crippled financially, but musically, we’re growing as we have abundant time to compose, rehearse and make good music. We’ve also groomed and added a new female musician Shalah as we aim to broaden our fans scope,” said Mr Gibbonz.
