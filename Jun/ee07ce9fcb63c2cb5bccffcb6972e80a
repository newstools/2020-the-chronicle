THE forensic audit report for the 2014 African Union Sports Council Region Five Under-20 Youth Games is now undergoing scrutiny by the Parliamentary portfolio committee on sport, education and arts amid fears that some bigwigs looted State resources. The Games were held in Bulawayo with the government pouring  US$18 million upfront to service providers but then Minister of Sport Makhosini Hlongwane ordered a forensic audit after expressing disappointment on some construction work that was done compared to the amount that was paid. It is suspected that some members of the local organising committee working in cahoots with officials from the ministries of Sport as well as Local Government and National Housing inflated prices and shared the loot. “The report is out yes and its now undergoing scrutiny from the Parliamentary portfolio committee,  we hope that soon they will take a position,” said permanent secretary in the Ministry of Youth, sport, arts and Recreation Thokozile Chitepo.
