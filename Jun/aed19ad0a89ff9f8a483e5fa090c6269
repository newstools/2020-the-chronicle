FIFA yesterday said it was keenly following suspended Zifa vice-president Gift Banda’s case after Zifa lost its appeal against him. Banda was suspended by the Zifa executive committee barely a month after winning the vice presidency by defeating Omega Sibanda by 35 votes to 22. The Bulawayo businessman was subsequently suspended on January 18 by the new Zifa executive committee for allegedly usurping powers of the committee by unilaterally making changes to the senior national team technical set up. Banda announced the appointment of Tonderayi Ndiraya and Bongani Mafu as the Warriors’ assistant coaches, replacing Lloyd Mutasa and Rahman Gumbo. However, the Zifa disciplinary committee chaired by Tendai Masawi exonerated Banda, ruling that he had merely recommended and not dismissed anyone. He argued that none of the officials that were either dismissed or appointed received confirmation letters. Zifa lodged an appeal with the Zifa Appeals Committee led by Stead Kachere which upheld the disciplinary committee ruling after Zifa allegedly failed to pay the $125 000 appeal fee. Kachere said their ruling meant Banda has to be reinstated, but Zifa lawyer Chenaimoyo Gumiro argues that the Bulawayo businessman remained suspended. Thayssa Plum from the Fifa communications department said the world football governing body was following the case with interest and will make a pronouncement soon. “Thank you for your email, we are checking internally and will get back to you as soon as possible,” Plum said in an emailed response to Chronicle Sport’s inquiry over the unfolding chaos at Zifa.
