VILLAGE health workers operating in various wards in Gwanda have taken an active role in the fight against Covid-19. The work of the volunteers who dedicate their time towards promoting health and hygiene in rural communities has, however, gone unnoticed. After receiving training on Covid-19 village health workers have pioneered awareness of the pandemic in their respective communities. With limited resources and no means of transportation they have displayed commitment towards fulfilling their duties. Mrs Juliet Mwindisi, a village health worker based in Mtshabezi Village, Ward 6 in Gwanda said after being trained on Covid-19 related issues she has moved around her community educating villagers. She said it has also been her role to ensure that villagers complied with Covid-19 regulations. “As a village health worker it has been my duty to educate people on Covid-19 and the measures that have been put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic. I have been moving from one homestead to the other on foot educating people on the pandemic while at the same time maintaining social distancing to ensure my safety and of the people I interact with. “I have educated people on the importance of wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and remaining indoors. I have also educated people on the importance of washing their hands regularly using soap. “In my community I have also encouraged people to set up tippy taps at their gates which have soapy water where people can wash their hands upon entry into their homesteads and where people can also wash their hands after using the toilet,” she said. Mrs Mwindisi said at community meetings it was her duty to ensure that tippy taps were set up where people could wash their hands. She said as a village health worker she also makes sure that people observed social distancing during meetings. She has served as a village health worker for the past 18 years and one of the major challenges she faced was lack of transportation. Mrs Mwindisi said she has to walk a distance of about eight kilometres to reach the furthest point in her village. As a result she sometimes has to leave her home at around 5AM to make it to the furthest parts of the village. “I have been a village health worker since 2002 when I received my training. It has always been my desire to serve my community and be an ambassador for the Ministry of Health. Despite the challenges I encounter such as walking long distances I remain committed towards this voluntary work but there is also need for us to be equipped so that we can do our work efficiently,” she said. Ms Sithokozile Nyoni who is a village health worker in Garanyemba Village in Ward 13 said some villagers were however facing a challenge in observing the precautionary measures on Covid-19 despite her efforts to educate them. She said some community members were complaining that they did not have soap to use when washing their hands. She said others were complaining that they needed proper masks as they did not trust the cloths that they were using to cover their faces. Ms Nyoni said some community members were not complying with the Covid-19 regulation of social distancing as they were gathering in groups at business centres drinking beer. “Even though we are moving around educating the community some people are genuinely struggling to comply while others are just being resistant. Some people don’t have the soap to use to wash their hands while others are not observing the rule on social distancing. “However we continue to be persistent is educating them with the hope that they will finally heed the message,” she said. Ms Nyoni said their work would become easier if they had all the necessary equipment. She said there was need for them to have protective clothing such as gloves and masks especially during this time when there was a pandemic. She said they used to collect medication from clinics which they used to assist community members but of late they were not getting any supplies. Ms Nyoni said they also needed airtime to contact the clinic in case of emergencies. Ms Sithulile Bhebhe who is also village health worker in Sifanyani Village in Garanyemba said it takes her about five hours to walk to the furthest part of her village. <img class="wp-image-500726 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-16-at-00.53.08-680x406.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="406" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-16-at-00.53.08.jpeg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-16-at-00.53.08-360x215.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Sithulile Bhebhe She said she normally conducted her visits three times a week. Ms Bhebhe said other duties she conducted included educating the community on various health issues, hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, malnutrition, engaging women to start various livelihood projects such as floor polish-making and bakery projects among others, spearheading the establishment of nutritional gardens. She said village health workers were also part of village saving and lending groups in the community and part of health clubs. Ms Bhebhe said she also conducted visits to expecting mothers in the community and clinics to educate them on maternal health issues such as eating a balanced diet. She said she also provided post-natal education. She said she also visited ill people in the community to ensure they were properly looked after and were adhering to their treatment. Mrs Bhebhe said as village health workers they were also given malaria kits which they use to community members for malaria as Gwanda was a malaria prone areas. She said if need arose it was her duty to refer malaria patients to clinics if they were in a serious state. She said they were awaiting to receive tests kits to conduct Covid-19 rapid tests as they were informed that they would be coming. “As village health workers we serve as a link between the Ministry of Health and the community. We work with the people and we live among the people which makes it easier to reach out to the community and identify problems in the community. If we identify a problem which is beyond our capacity as village health workers we alert the clinic. “Being a village health worker has enhanced me as an individual as I have in-depth knowledge on various health issues. We don’t only get an opportunity to educate the community but we also learn in the process. I was trained at the onset but continue to undergo training in various issues,” she said. Speaking recently on behalf of acting District Medical Officer who is also acting Gwanda Provincial Hospital Medical Superintendent, Dr Blessed T Gwarimbo, Dr Elton Ndlovu a medical practitioner at the Gwanda Provincial Hospital said health workers were critical to the Ministry as they were a link with the communities. “The role of village heath workers is to link us with the communities. As health personnel we can’t be visible in each and every part of the community and therefore the village health workers bridge this gap. “They are our ear on the ground and they keep us informed. They also play a pivotal role in educating the community on various health related issues. They also help to reach the furthest parts of every community,” he said. — @DubeMatutu.
