2020 marked both the 20th anniversary of the American Black Entertainment Television Network (BET) awards and BET’s 40th anniversary. This year’s awards show that was held virtually on Sunday evening (American time), highlighted the absolute best in entertainment, social justice and culture with moving performances and appearances by some of the biggest names across television, film, and music; spreading and inspiring an important message of hope and change. Africa was well represented as Sho Madjozi, Burna Boy and INNOSS’B battled it out for the number one spot in the Best International Act category while Sha Sha and Remi were nominated in the Viewer’s Choice Best New International Act category. Pan-African superstar and globally recognised Burna Boy won Best International Act for the second time running during the virtually produced BET Awards 2020 show. New sensation, Zimbabwean Sha Sha collected the Viewer’s Choice Best New International Act award. Monde Twala, Senior Vice President and General Manager of ViacomCBS Networks Africa and Peer Lead BET International said: “The Best International Act categories over the years have honoured the outstanding achievements of some of the most talented international acts from across the world. “BET is committed to shining a light on talent, elevating our culture and promoting diversity through song. This year’s winners and nominees reflect an abundance of creative expression. We salute all the nominees and winners.” The BET Awards celebrated not only its 20th anniversary but also the increased focus currently on the Black community and culture Sunday. The theme of Sunday’s show “Our Culture Can’t Be Cancelled” came at a time of cultural unrest over racial injustice in the wake of George Floyd’s death while in the custody of Minneapolis police. The ceremony was an extraordinary celebration of black culture, love, joy, and pride, setting a new bar for awards shows produced during the ongoing pandemic. The show was broadcast virtually in response to safety precautions in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Winners in the 21 categories were selected by BET’s Voting Academy, which is made up of fans and an esteemed group of entertainment professionals.
