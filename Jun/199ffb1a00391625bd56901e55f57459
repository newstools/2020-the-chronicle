The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter IN preparation for return of cricket, Tuskers have upped their operations by disinfecting training fields. There are three facilities under Zimbabwe Cricket and managed by Tuskers in Bulawayo, Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo Athletic Club (BAC) and Emakhandeni Cricket Club. Nicholas Singo, Tuskers’ general manager, said while awaiting the return of club action, they have been busy with a lot of ground work. “We have disinfected and repaired the wickets as well as done general maintenance on the outfield. We also attended to BAC, including its outfield, which had overgrown grass,” said Singo. Cricket is one of the few disciplines that have been given the green light to restart during the Covid-19 Lebel 2 lockdown. The senior national men’s team has started training, while waiting for government approval to host Afghanistan for limited-overs series between July and August. @ZililoR
