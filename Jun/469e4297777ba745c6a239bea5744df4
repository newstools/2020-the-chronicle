FORMER radio personality, businesswoman Emma Nxumalo yesterday celebrated her birthday by donating food and clothing to Queen Elizabeth Children’s Home and Jabulani Flats in Bulawayo as part of her #MyBabyToo initiative. #MyBabyToo is a cause founded last year by Nxumalo to assist less privileged children in the city. Nxumalo gave foodstuffs and clothes to 12 families with vulnerable children at Jabulani Flats. The donated things included bread, sugar beans, soya chunks, cabbages, and toothpaste. Emma who was part of last year’s Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAA) fashion police urged people to take up such initiatives as there are people suffering out there. “I was heart-broken when one of the grannies cried saying some of the food items (that were donated) were now like luxury. We as a community should try as much as we can to help our fellow brothers and sisters,” she said. “The Covid-19 pandemic has made the lives of the less privileged children hard because most of them are supported by their grannies who used to sell tomatoes in the streets and now, they are locked down and have lost their source of income.” Jabulani Flats residents’ association chairperson, Pamela Mackay thanked Nxumalo for the timely donation saying such interventions always pass them by. “We’re grateful for what she has done for us. The people are really going through a difficult time like other wards in the city. “However, some people get some help but for us in Ward 1, we are often skipped. “The only donations we get are from Feed the City and Bulawayo City Council who usually donate to the elderly if they have something,” said Mackay. She said because of hunger, some children have started resorting to stealing.
