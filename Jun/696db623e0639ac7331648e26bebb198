The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ONE of the main mandates of the nine-member Zifa constitutional review committee is to insert a clause barring politicians from contesting the association’s elections. Zifa recently unveiled a nine-member constitutional review committee consisting of Kelvin Musimwa, Martin Kweza, Highlanders chairman Kenneth Mhlophe, Simon Simango, Beaullar Musara, Wilbert Simba, Gilbert Saika and Mehluli Thebe. Only Musimwa and Simango have a legal background. That clause is believed to be targeted at completely shutting the door on former Zifa president Phillip Chiyangwa and his deputy Omega Sibanda, who are serving members of Parliament. “The idea to review the constitution is a noble one, no qualms with that but it’s the sinister motive that is worrying. Once a constitution is crafted with such motives then it becomes flawed and is bound to be defective along the way,” said an insider. Concerns have also been raised about the composition of the committee, as seven of the nine members are all serving councillors with vested interests.
