The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) is inviting filmmakers to submit entries for the annual Piton International Film Festival (PIFF) which this year, is taking place online from August 18 to 29 August. PIFF, which normally takes place on the Caribbean Island of St Lucia, is a 12-month programme that focuses on celebrating film-making and seeks to work collaboratively with filmmakers from around the world. In a statement, NACZ said they have partnered with PIFF to provide local filmmakers an opportunity to learn and collaborate with others from across the globe. The partnership will see locally-based filmmakers who submit their works through the NACZ offices, getting a discounted entry fee for a maximum of two submissions. “PIFF provides filmmakers an opportunity to understand the various aspects of the global film industry through workshops and seminars, while also assisting independent content creators with opportunities to expose and monetise their artworks. “The NACZ/PIFF partnership aims to discover and expose new filmmaking talent in Zimbabwe through showcasing their works on the PIFF social media sites as well as broadcast on the Sisters in Harmony Network,” NACZ said. Registration is open from now until July 31.
