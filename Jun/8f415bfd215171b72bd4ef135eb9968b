UNITED States of America-based former Warriors and Highlanders captain Thulani  Ncube has launched a clothing line “Biya 4” named after his nickname and the jersey number the defender donned in Bosso and national team colours. Ncube wants to follow in the footsteps of other popular sports personalities that launched successful clothing lines. The power of the celebrity fashion line is undeniable and over the years celebrities have leveraged their star power to launch their own brands. Ncube took to social media to announce the arrival of his Biya 4 clothing line, posting a picture written “B4C…Biya 4 Clothing.” The Bosso legend, who lives in Plainfield, Indiana, is considered one of the best defenders to captain the club. His clothing line includes T-shirts, caps and shorts. His social media followers applauded him for the move and promised to support his venture, while some, mostly those based in South Africa, inquired about the products, and asked him to notify them how and where they can purchase his Biya 4 products. Ncube simply responded: “Working on it”. @ZililoR
