WHEELSPINNERS House Militia duo and African Smosh are billed to perform at the Bulawayo LIVE sessions tomorrow evening. The show which is being conducted on Facebook every Thursday is part of efforts to promote the city’s talent by exposing the artistes’ to new audiences in the virtual space. It will be streamed live from a studio in Pelandaba suburb tomorrow from 7pm to 9pm on the Bulawayo Unlocked, Fokus Magazine, Umahlekisa Comedy Club and Ingwebu Breweries Zimbabwe Facebook pages. The event is set to be a deep house affair as House Militia duo comprising of Mandlenkosi “Master M” Mkandla and Denzil “DaHousemaniac” Zulu who are known for their Sunday Chillaz, which saw many from Lobengula appreciate deep house tunes, will be taking care of business. As for African Smosh, he is one of the finest young house DJs in the city. At the age of 19, he became a resident DJ at Pub Lagondola. Event organiser, Dalu Van Vodloza said they are exploring other means to get their show to the people after realising that some are failing to watch it online due to data constraints. “Now on our third episode, we’ve managed to maintain a steady hype, but the data challenges are real for our local fans who, although they’d love to watch the shows, are failing to. “As a result, we’re exploring other means of content distribution in order to reach more people,” Vodloza said. “This week’s episode will see House Militia take the viewers on a deep house journey and bring fond memories to Sunday Chillas patrons. The tribal beats of African Smosh will showcase why he scored club residency at just the age of 19,” he said. @mthabisi_mthire
