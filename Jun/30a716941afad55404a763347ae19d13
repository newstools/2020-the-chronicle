THE search for a presenter for the fast growing online Nash TV intensifies at midday today as the second round of auditions takes place. The auditions are taking place in Harare and streaming live from the Nash Paints studio. Nash TV has for the past two months, been leading the online musical shows with viewers being exposed to various up-and-coming artistes. Power FM presenter Tariro “Butterphly Phunk” Mharapara has been presenting the shows. Because of the growth of the show, more presenters are now needed in order to maintain the show’s relevance. The adjudication panel is comprised of Butterphly Phunk, Chillspot Records co-founder Rodger “Levels” Kadzimwe, artistes’ manager Godfrey “Vokal” Bakasa and Star FM presenter Phathisani Sibanda. A guest judge is expected today. Said Butterphly Phunk: “About 200 people registered for the first round which took place last week and we narrowed it down to 60 for the second round. After that, we’ll select the best 30 then get into the finals that will be held on Saturday. “We’re targeting to get not just one presenter, but a number that we cannot disclose at the moment. We’re looking for people with undeniable charisma, confidence and knowledge on the subject they will be presenting.” Prominent among those that auditioned last week are Constituency Talk presenter Deliwe Mhaka, former Studio 263 actor Charity Dlodlo and afro-pop musician Harmony. With not much entertainment during the lockdown, the presenter search which has been structured in the form of a show is now entertaining people with some finding other hopefuls hilarious. @mthabisi_mthire
