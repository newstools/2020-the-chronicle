A 38-YEAR-OLD man has been arrested after he allegedly raped and robbed his 19-year-old girlfriend at her workplace in ‘revenge’ after she decided to dump him. The man who cannot be named to protect the identity of his victim was not asked to plead when he appeared before Gwanda magistrate, Mr Ndumiso Khumalo facing a rape and robbery charge. He was remanded in custody to June 16. Prosecuting, Miss Faith Mutukwa said the man raped the complainant on March 11 while she was alone in a shop where she is employed and took R1 000 from her. “On 11 March at around 5PM the accused person went to the complainant’s workplace to visit her. The complainant then told the accused person that she wanted to break up with him as she no longer loved him. The accused begged the complainant to reconsider her decision as he still loved her but she refused. The accused person left the complainant’s workplace furious and warned her that he would return to get revenge,” she said. “On 17 March at around 7PM the accused person arrived at the complainant’s workplace after she had knocked off and was preparing to retire to bed and entered through a back door which was unlocked. The complainant ordered the accused person to leave but he refused and threatened to kill her if she didn’t comply with his orders.” Miss Mutukwa said the accused person raped the complainant and he remained in the shop until 4AM the following day. Miss Mutukwa said the accused person then searched the shop and found R1 000 which he took and then fled from the scene. He threatened to kill the complainant if she reported the matter. “After the accused person had gone the complainant went home and advised her mother of what the accused person had done to her. The matter was reported to the police resulting in the arrest of the accused person,” she said.-@DubeMatutu
