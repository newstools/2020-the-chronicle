Hip hop artiste Six Oh has released a song titled Love to Hate that features one of Zimbabwe’s hip hop veterans Stunner. The song was produced, mixed and mastered by Bulawayo’s P2DaOh. It is the second track that Six Oh has done with Stunner after releasing one called Matanga last year. It was launched at Club Hash Tag in Bulawayo. Six Oh (real name Tapiwa Matarise) said the track talks about how people put one on a pedestal, love you and after that, bring you down. “The concept of the track is based on how people love you when things are going well and how they turn on you because rumours or a down moment and love you again when things start looking up. “We also strongly emphasize how one should stick to their lane and continue to solider on doing what they do best,” said Six Oh.
