Puppeteering is an intriguing part of edutainment that a young Bulawayo artiste, Tyrese Maseko has taken up to educate and entertain, especially children, about the Covid-19 pandemic. The 18-year-old has come up with a five-part series titled Uncle Tyrese and Friends through which he is teaching children about the dangers of Covid-19. Inspired by Gundi loMazwi puppets on SABC1, Maseko said he wanted to use his skills to educate people and also earn money from his talent. “I was inspired by the SABC 1 show, Gundi loMazwi and this spurred me to start doing ventriloquism in 2012. This is what I have been doing ever since I was in high school and this is how I earn money. “People hire me to perform at schools, churches and roadshows,” said Maseko. Maseko who attended Mguza Adventist Primary School said the reception from his friends all through into high school at Nketa High was discouraging as most people told him what he was doing was worthless. “They all said what I was doing wasn’t going to take me anywhere. This made me feel bad and in fact discouraged me at one point. But along the way, I became determined not to quit as this was my talent,” he said. Now, with many years of puppeteering, he has come of age and wants to broaden his wings. As such, he is appealing to Government and well-wishers for funding to help him pursue his art in a stronger way. “I’d like the Government to help fund my art with US$20 000. This money will be used to buy a car for my puppet kit to move from one place to another. I also want to buy cameras so I can record and post educational lessons to children. Also, I’d like to buy a PA system,” said Maseko. Maseko’s works were featured as part of the entertainment during the Skyz Metro FM Awards last year where his puppets sang two songs, Ngeke Siguqe by gospe l acappella group Reality 7 and Cheerleader by Pentatonix.
