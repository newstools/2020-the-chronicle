THE Impande Football League has taken huge strides towards ensuring a safe return to action for its players by handing out personal protective equipment to each team and officials in the league. The rural league that was formed in Plumtree this year seeks to promote and develop footballing talent in and around the Empandeni area. It features teams 10 teams — Baghdad, Hanyani, Kwite, Linda, Matankeni, Mhlotshana, Mkhayeni, Mvalweni, Phakamani and Silima football clubs, which are all from Empandeni and Plumtree. Co-ordinator Kudzanai Dojiwe Ndlovu said: “We are pleased to announce that we have acquired personal protective equipment for our teams. “We have also sourced some infrared thermometers, which will be used before training and matches. Branded face masks will also be distributed to the teams. We are working tirelessly to ensure that when the league resumes, players, supporters and the communities are protected from the Covid-19 pandemic. We cannot wait to get back to the playing field.” The Impande league was in its third week of action when the lockdown was declared at the end of March, with Mhlotshana FC topping the table with nine points, followed by Linda with six points and Matankeni on the same number of points. Mkhayeni were the only team yet to record victory and anchored the league table with a duck. To ensure that Impande Football League achieves its objectives, each team is required to register at least seven Under-20 players out of a squad of 25. A minimum of three Under-20 players should be compulsorily given game time in every match. — @innocentskizoe
