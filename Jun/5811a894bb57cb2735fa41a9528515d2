Sandy, who rose to fame in the early 2000s when she was part of Iyasa, has lived to her word that it was high time she diversifies and spreads her wings to neighbouring countries. Commenting on the video premiering on the regional channel, Sandy said: “I’m so humbled and this has made ensure that I push harder. Soon, I’ll be releasing an album that I’m working on at the moment.” Two years ago, Sandy worked with Professor on the hit single Lizwile.
