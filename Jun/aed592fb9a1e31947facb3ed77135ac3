The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo,  Senior Sports Reporter THE government has set aside a $20 million bailout fund for football and other sport codes to alleviate their plight caused by the novel Covid-19 pandemic that has paralysed sporting activities across the globe. Permanent secretary in the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Thokozile Chitepo confirmed the development in an exclusive interview with Chronicle online yesterday. Since the announcement of the initial lockdown period by President Mnangagwa in March, sporting events have been in limbo with 15 low risk sport codes being allowed to resume, albeit under very strict guidelines, during the President’s third lockdown review announcement. “His Excellency the President when he launched the stimulus and recovery package for the other sectors, among that list of sectors, mining and agriculture, there was funds allocated for athletes and artists. $20 million was put aside, I think within the next week or two we will be announcing the terms, slightly different from those of the youths,” said Chitepo.
