ZIMBABWE and Kaizer Chiefs poster boy Khama Billiat has been presented with a brand new pair of football boots by sports apparel giant Adidas. The 30-year-old Billiat became the first Zimbabwean player to sign an endorsement deal with the sportswear giant in 2012 while still playing for Ajax Cape Town and the romance has continued to this day. Khama revealed the gesture through a video post on his Twitter timeline in which he said Adidas had been wonderful to him. “I just wanna thank Adidas, they have been wonderful to me,” a smiling Billiat said as he displayed his new prized possession. The deal made Billiat the face of Adidas in Zimbabwe as the German headquartered sportswear manufacture sought to utilise the player’s profile to grow its market in the country. Speaking soon after the endorsement deal back in 2012, Billiat said it was a dream come true for him and thanked Adidas for its decision to settle for him among a host of other players. Other well known football stars with Adidas endorsement deals include Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale, Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah as well as Paul Pogba of Manchester United.
