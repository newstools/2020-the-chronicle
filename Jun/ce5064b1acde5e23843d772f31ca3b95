Three people were killed in an accident involving three vehicles yesterday morning along the Gweru-Shurugwi highway near Guinea Fowl Secondary School, about 20km from Gweru. The accident which involved a commuter omnibus, a haulage truck and a Ford Ranger double cab, occurred at the 19,5km peg around 9AM. Two people who were aboard the commuter omnibus, which had three people including the driver and a passenger in the twin cab died on the spot. The driver of the haulage truck escaped unhurt. Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Joel Goko confirmed the accident. He said the double cab vehicle was travelling behind the commuter omnibus from Gweru going towards Shurugwi while the truck was traveling in the opposite direction. Insp Goko said on approaching the 19,5km peg, the Ford Ranger vehicle tried to overtake the commuter omnibus. “The driver of the Ford Ranger vehicle moved to the right intending to overtake but noticed that there was an oncoming haulage truck. He then slowed down in an attempt to return to his lane,” said Insp Goko. In the process, he said, the Ford Ranger vehicle sideswiped with the commuter omnibus which swerved into the oncoming haulage truck lane. “The commuter omnibus was crushed by the haulage truck which jack-knifed facing the direction it was coming from killing two people from the commuter omnibus while the Ford Ranger vehicle veered off the road and crashed into a tree, killing one person,” said Insp Goko. He urged motorists to observe road signs when travelling to curb the unnecessary loss of life. “There are curves and road signs in this area where the accident happened and it’s unfortunate that motorists continue to ignore the signs which are meant to save lives,” he said.
