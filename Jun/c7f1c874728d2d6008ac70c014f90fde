The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Producers of Uhangwela, a television soapie mostly in Venda, have teased fans online by releasing one episode on YouTube while they wait for the ZBCtv premiere. As the word uhangwela means forgiveness, the soapie chronicles events of people who are unable to forgive yet they want to be forgiven. It portrays people who find themselves at crossroads without a clear choice of whether to let go or seek revenge. The soapie which has 14 episodes was shot in the border town of Beitbridge. While it is largely in Venda, it has some bits of Shona, Ndebele, Sotho and English. <img class="size-full wp-image-501814" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Uhangwela.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Uhangwela.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Uhangwela-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Behind the scenes from Uhangwela Its producer, Emmanuel Ncube said the teaser is to create anxiety among the audience. “We’ve put the first episode on YouTube in order to look for fans and companies who want to advertise.
