ONE of the country’s finest midfielders Johannes “Tshisa” Ngodzo has warned players that they risk a brutal end to their careers if they play money games during the Covid-19 national lockdown. A number of players contracted to Division One and Premier Soccer League clubs, especially in Harare, have in the past weeks been playing money games in various suburbs. “What they are doing is not good at all. We know it’s been long without football, but to then engage in those money games is not only unprofessional but risky. “They must know that careers can come to a brutal end and once you are injured in such games, you must forget about any assistance from your employers. “Injuries in such games can’t be ruled out because as long as there is money involved, tackles are always going to be hard so I would really advise those involved to stop this defiance,” warned Ngodzo. The former Highlanders and Warriors’ star midfielder’s promising career was cut short by an ankle injury, while on national team duty against Eritrea. Ngodzo, who won the Zifa Southern Region Division One championship as coach with Bantu Rovers in 2016, said if players want to keep fit, they should do individual exercises or even play Five-a-Side non-competitive matches rather than engage in money games. He said those engaged in money games must weigh the dangers instead of being blinkered by the little money they will get.
