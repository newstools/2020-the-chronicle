HOUSE musician Bhadilah has released his solo EP titled Mpho nga Mpho which reminds people of their culture. The four-track EP now available on his YouTube channel, BhadilahVevo, has songs Ndo Munanga, cover single Mpho nga Mpho, M’badeleni and Replacement. It was produced by up-and-coming Beitbridge producer Geezo. Listening to the tracks, the musician who has, with pride, popularised the Venda culture through his music over the years, continued to do so on this EP as he went all out and fused his music with the Limpopo house genre known as Bolo House that is used by the likes of Master KG on Qinisela and Jerusalema and Makhadzi on Matorokisi. The award-winning musician said he would have wanted to launch the EP through a live performance online but due to limited resources, he could not do so. “I’d have loved to launch the EP through an online live performance, but funds did not permit. Nonetheless, the project it out and is one for my fans to enjoy,” Bhadilah said. – @mthabisi_mthire
