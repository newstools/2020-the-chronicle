The Chronicle A former teammate of Khama Billiat is backing the Kaizer Chiefs star to rise again, after the former PSL Footballer of the Season appeared to struggle for game time under coach Ernst Middendorp. The Zimbabwean star’s ex-teammate from when he first arrived at Ajax Cape Town in 2010 Lizo Mjempu has backed the 29-year-old to be back at his best. “Khama is still the player that we all know. But now the problem I see I would say it’s the system that they play. I don’t think the way Chiefs play suits Khama. Fortunately, Billiat is a player that grew up in front of me and I saw him develop,” ex-defender said. “I remember him from the time he first arrived at Ajax and coach Foppe de Haan would spend some time with him at training and working on things like his first touch, and he became a better player in front of me. I even told him at Ajax that he would become a big player and I am not surprised. His speed stood out for me, as well as his agility,” he added. — Soccer Laduma
