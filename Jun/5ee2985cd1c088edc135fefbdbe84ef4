The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter
ZIMBABWE has no significant reality shows yet a series of personalities are from time to time proving that they have what it takes to keep the country entertained. These include comedian Mai TT, Passion Java, Genius “Ginimbi” Kadungure, Olinda Chapel, Pokello Nare, Carl Joshua Ncube, Stunner and Mudiwa among others who each time they have pressed the live button on social media, have trended and attracted thousands of views on their various accounts. Just this week, Passion Java and Mai TT provided entertainment for people after Java took a dig at Mai TT during a live interview on ZimboLive claiming that she was bitter as he had not bought a car for her, opting to buy for her nemesis, comedian Madam Boss. This did not go down well with the vocal Mai TT who requested to be added onto the live to no success. She decided to give her own side of the story by conducting her own live stream where she took a dig on Java and labelled him a bully who is causing conflict in the arts fraternity. Over 7 000 people watched both live streams that ran concurrently on Tuesday evening showing the interest people have in these personalities issues. As this was happening, rapper Stunner on the other hand was being accused by his girlfriend, Dyonne of raping her 16-year-old sister. This saw the likes of Stunner’s ex-girlfriend Olinda chipping in through a live video where she discussed the issue, attracting more thousands of people. Over and above, the social media streets were very busy this week leaving many wondering why these personalities do not come up with reality shows. It is no secret that TV stations are running out of content as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic which is making it difficult for programmes to come up with fresh content, so such personalities can chip in with their content and keep people entertained. Below is a list of potential shows the country could enjoy. Twabam Life
New entry Passion Java of the twabam fame has proved that he is a magnet. His sayings like ndokutsotsonya and twabam whose meanings are unclear as they really do not have meaning, have caught on to people, showing how much influence he has. Videos in which he will be bragging about his top-of-the-range vehicles, home and private jet have done rounds. Ever since his emergence on the showbiz scene, he has been trending so a reality show by him would definitely be a success. <img class="wp-image-502041 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Passion-Java-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Passion-Java.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Passion-Java-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Passion Java Mai TT’s Diaries
Mai TT for the people. Just like Olinda, Mai TT is another person who seems to enjoy the attention she gets on social media. This attention seeking can be used for the benefit of viewers as she always has something to say which always gets people’s attention. If she is not publicly telling people her HIV status, she is claiming there are people who want her dead. If not that, she will be bragging about her new love, relationships which never seem to last, sadly for her. <img class="wp-image-452739 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/mai-tt-memory-and-madam-boss-680x380.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/mai-tt-memory-and-madam-boss.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/mai-tt-memory-and-madam-boss-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mai TT, Memory and Madam Boss Keeping up with Miss Chapel
Olinda. It feels like she has been running a reality show all this time as people have been involved in her relationships since her breakup with rapper Stunner when she went public about it through a Facebook live video where she broke down. Thereafter, people followed her up until she dated Tytan and the two had another public fallout that was well broadcast on social media. Such is the life of Olinda. <img class="wp-image-424417 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/OLINDA-C-680x391.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="391" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/OLINDA-C.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/OLINDA-C-360x207.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Olinda Chapel Queen of swagger
Pokello. Ever since the emergence of her sextape with Stunner, her life has been under scrutiny.

Other than that, people like her style and sense of dressing. Recently, she introduced what she termed Sunday confessions where she encourages people to share their confessions, a concept that has been well received. So Pokello is sitting on content which people can enjoy. Ginimbi — My life your TV
Ginimbi, a party animal with a huge following can also have a show where he flaunts his wealth, shares clips of his parties and twerk-shows among many other concepts. He at one point hinted he was working on such a show but it just died down. <img class="wp-image-479448 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Ginimbi56-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Ginimbi56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Ginimbi56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ginimbi Carl and Nelsy diaries
