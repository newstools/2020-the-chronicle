The Chronicle Business Editor THE Tourism Business Council of Zimbabwe (TBCZ) has called on Government to grant formal approvals facilitating urgent re-opening of domestic travel within set health guidelines so as to preserve national economic interests. Tourism operations in the country remain frozen under the lockdown period with scores of workers in the sector and downstream losing jobs. Although domestic tourism is seen as the immediate path to save the sector, no formal approvals have been made to facilitate re-opening of the business. In a statement today, TBCZ pesident Ms Winnie Muchanyuka, said the travel and tourism sector has formulated a plan of action for the phased re-opening of travel and tourism in Zimbabwe, which has been presented to the Ministry of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality for consideration and formal approvals. “It is generally agreed that priority should be given to the urgent facilitation of domestic tourism in the current circumstances,” she said. “Focus on regional and international travel and tourism  is related to a number of external factors but facilitation of domestic tourism at this time is both achievable and desirable, as well as necessary for resuscitation of the sector and for national economic progress.” Ms Muchanyuka said TBCZ was active in this process in partnership with the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority and would continue to call for re-opening of all relevant facilities and amenities as well as for support for domestic travel. Once this has been arranged, she said, attention can be given to working out suitable strategies for the revival of incoming regional and international travel and tourism. “The exercise is underpinned by recognition of the enormous economic significance to Zimbabwe of tourism,” she said.
