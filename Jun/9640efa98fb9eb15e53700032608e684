Ngamnanka hit-maker, Madlela Skhobokhobo has set August 7 as the day he will finally launch his third album titled Ntikoloshi. The album, a follow up to Majazana which he released last year, was supposed to be launched at Phoenix Night Club in Gwanda on April 4, but due to the ban on public gatherings, he was forced to abort the mission. The Nkayi-born and Gwanda-bred artiste said the tracks on the album are a mixture of rhumba, tshibilika, Afro-jazz, house and gospel tunes. They are, Ntikoloshi, Karikiriki, Salibonani, Njelele featuring Nkosi, I 50 duuu, Station featuring Iyasa, Emasurbabsin featuring Awa, Hwabaraty and Bajilla, Khumbule Khaya, Impi and Tambai which features Bajila. Some of the tracks Emasurbabsin and Khumbule Khaya have already been released as singles while others which were meant to be on the album have been scrapped. Commenting on the production, Madlela said he was thrilled to finally share his music with fans who have been impatiently waiting for it. He said to top it off, he will be working on visuals for some of the songs, starting on Sunday. â€” @mthabisi_mthire.
