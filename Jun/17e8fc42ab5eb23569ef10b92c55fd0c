Police in Beitbridge have intercepted two men who were trying to smuggle 19 600 day-old-chicks from South Africa into Zimbabwe. The two men were busted on Tuesday evening near Panda Mine area soon after entering the country. The value of the chicks is yet to be ascertained. Matabeleland South Police spokesperson, Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the incident yesterday. “The matter has since been referred to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) for further management. We understand that the chicks were destroyed by fire as per standard customs regulations.” Admire Ndlovu of Chief Mazetese in Situpa area of Mwenezi and Prince Gumbo of Dulivhadzimu suburb in Beitbridge have since been charged with smuggling. A source close to the case said Ndlovu was found with 8 820 chicks while Gumbo was transporting 10 780 chicks. “Following their arrest, they were taken to Zimra where the chicks were destroyed,” said the source. The smuggling of humans and goods along the Limpopo River has heightened following the lockdown in both Zimbabwe and South Africa. Groceries, baby diapers, electrical gadgets and cigarettes are some of the major items being smuggled across borders. Government has beefed up security on the border to minimise criminal activities. Since the start of the lockdown, the police have arrested more than 30 people recovering goods worth millions of rand from an estimated 200 illegal crossing points.
