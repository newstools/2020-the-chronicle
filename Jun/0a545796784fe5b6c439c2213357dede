The Chronicle Miranda Sazini Ncube, a 19-year-old girl from Tsholotsho is hopeful to be crowned Miss Rural Africa and land the prize money of US$10 000. Miss Rural Africa is a beauty pageant for young women based in African rural areas. It is run by Oil Castor, a bio-technology company based in Harare in search of an ambassador for their company. Ncube who hails from Lupinde village said she always wanted to be a model, but unfortunately, could not fulfil her hopes as there were no pageants in her area. “My dream is to be a top model, but there haven’t been opportunities for modelling for people like me who’re based in the rural areas. To pursue this passion, one has to move to the big cities. “However, through this pageant, I hope to fulfil my dream as it’ll be a good launch-pad for my modelling career,” said Ncube. With 20 girls in the running for the title, Ncube said she hopes to have outshone them as judges are currently tallying votes and coming up with the winner after voting closed on May 30. “There’re 20 girls participating and for the past weeks, I have been leading in terms of votes with more than 300 votes. But the person behind me was hot in my heels so I’m just hoping for the best,” she said. She said if she lands the top prize, she hopes to transform the rural girl child. “Winning the pageant will mean the world to me because I really want to change rural life and empower women through awareness of gender equality and financial freedom so as to make Africa a better place to live. With the prize money, I will buy food, clothes and pads to donate to the less fortunate young women in rural areas,” she said. – @themkhust_ncube
