THE Zifa executive committee has been questioned for lifting the suspension of Bulawayo Province chairman Francis Ntutha after his provincial colleagues suspended him on allegations of maladministration. Ntutha was accused of paying himself $1 020 more than a year ago. The provincial leadership wrote to Zifa national executive requesting an audit of its books but that request was ignored. The Zifa national executive committee later ordered the Bulawayo Province executive to reinstate Ntutha saying the matter will be dealt with by way of summons. In its letter reinstating Ntutha, Zifa chief executive officer Joseph Mamutse ordered Bulawayo Province to engage independent auditors to examine their books for the period of the alleged offence. “I feel so sorry for the oldman (Mamutse), he is just being used by these guys and unfortunately he is in charge of the secretariat. There are a lot of questions that must be raised over this whole matter such as the timing of the lifting of the suspension. A number of executive committee meetings have been held but the issue was never discussed. Remember Ntutha was suspended in March last year,” said a Zifa councillor. Another coucillor said they have evidence that the resolution to lift Ntutha’s suspension was made in Kwekwe. “The Kwekwe meeting was supposed to be a sub-committee meeting but someone then smuggled this matter into the agenda hence the resolution,” said the councillor. After the executive ordered the reinstatment of Ntutha, the entire Bulawayo committee, except for John Mutero, resigned saying they could not work with Ntutha until he is cleared of the allegations levelled against him. Ntutha has said he is not moved by the en masse resignations and instead said two of the members who resigned were bitter after being told they could not take charge of public finances.
