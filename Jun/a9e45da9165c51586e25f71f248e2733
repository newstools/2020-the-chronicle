The Chronicle THE South African Football Association has responded to the government’s new regulations for level 3 of the nationwide lockdown. Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa confirmed that all sport, contact and non-contact, are allowed to return to training from today. Contact sport, which includes football, remains prohibited from resuming play in level 3, with the Premier Soccer League yet to communicate the latest on their on-going executive committee meetings. However, Safa’s acting CEO Tebogo Motlanthe has since responded to Mthethwa’s address. “We welcome the fact that athletes can start training under strict specific conditions. Furthermore, there are requirements for a thorough monitoring of all athletes to ensure full compliance,” he said. “It is also clear that contact sport like football and rugby among others cannot resume competitively under alert level 3 from the Minister’s briefing on Saturday.” “Safa welcomes such continued engagements, mindful of the negative financial impact Covid-19 has had on sport in general. Football, rugby and cricket are among the major sporting codes that have been heavily impacted by the pandemic,” he said. — Soccer Laduma
