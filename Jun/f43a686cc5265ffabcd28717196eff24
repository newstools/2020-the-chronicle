The rise in cases of women abuse by men during the lockdown has led South Africa-based Rhumba musician, Mxolisi “Mr Bones” Ndlovu to release a track calling them to order. Titled “Wathumela Amadoda”, the track which was released on YouTube will be part of the musician’s yet-to-be-named seventh album due for release later this year. In the track, Mr Bones appeals to men to stop abusing women adding that God created man to be the backbone of the family, love and care for the household. Mr Bones also urges women to report abusive men than to hope that they will change, as such men end up killing them. The musician said he penned the song after being irked by the high cases of killings of women in South Africa with cases of abuse back home also on the rise. “I did this single after noticing that during this Covid-19 lockdown, so many things are happening like the violence against women perpetrated by men which is unacceptable,” Mr Bones said. Mr Bones is well known for singing positively about women, a move he said is deliberate as he wants to appreciate them. “I’ve seen that most of us, male musicians, sing negatively about women so I took it upon myself to appreciate them. It’s also part of efforts to get them to support the rhumba genre knowing that we fight for their rights,” he said. His forthcoming album, the artiste said will hopefully be out in August. “My 7th album is due for release in August, but that will depend on how the Covid situation pans out. With increasing cases of Covid-19, it’s difficult to tell if that’ll be possible. Also, with borders closed, it’s hard to distribute the album so we’re closely monitoring the situation hoping that borders will be open soon so that our project hits the market,” he said, adding that the lockdown had given him time to fine-tune the album. — @bonganinkunzi @themkhust_ncube.
