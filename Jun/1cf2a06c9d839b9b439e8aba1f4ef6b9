Ngingu Golide mina lizongidinga lingiswele. NginguGolide, sengisiya emazweni, lizongidinga phansi, lingidinge phezulu. THESE are lyrics from the song Golide by Lovemore Majaivana. Through the song, Majaivana, a local music legend, told his fans that one day they will look high and low for him and over 20 years after the song was released, his words are ringing true in people’s ears as they are looking for him high and low as he prophesied. Golide is one of Majaivana’s totems. Prior to that, Majaivana, before ditching music in 2001 due to lack of support locally, had from time to time, been telling people that he was not happy. Through tracks Angila Mali and Ngifuna Imali, Majaivana shared his plight of not having money to further his career. What is however, surprising is that the yearning for Majaivana’s music gets louder each passing year as though he is dead when in fact, he is alive and well cooped up in America. When a documentary of him sharing his views during an interview with YouTube channel Zazise Wide was released recently, fond memories of the legend musician were rekindled. In the interview, Majaivana spoke about his history and the struggles that he faced during his time in Zimbabwe. He also gave a glimpse as to what caused him to quit music. Chief among the reasons was that he was not getting the support he expected. “My life has been a sad one. I’ve been dealt blows below the belt. First of all, it was the language that I sang in, it didn’t really bring me the fortune that one expects like when you look at these other people that sing in the widely known languages. <img class="alignnone wp-image-501140 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Lovemore-Majaivana-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Lovemore-Majaivana-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Lovemore-Majaivana-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “They get a better share of the profits. It’s partly why I left music because whenever I went to collect my cheque, I saw the other cheques of people that sang in different languages, they had better cheques than mine,” Majaivana told Zazise Wide. These were the words from a man who had not spoken in a long time. Ever since leaving the country some 20 years ago, Majaivana, has gone into recluse, shying from the public eye. Not even a recent picture of him has surfaced. When his documentary came out last week, people jumped at the opportunity to listen to him. This is because such interviews and instances that Majaivana speaks are rare and fare in-between. Although petitions have been made, signed and delivered, Majaivana has been unwavering. People want answers as to why he was in exile in America and what was he doing there. They want to hear whether their cries for Majaivana to come back had fallen on deaf ears. No two ways, Majaivana is missed like a dead musical icon in Zimbabwe. The album Isono Sami, was like his last offering to people and 20 years has been a long time for him not to say anything to his fans. Mthiyane Zondo summed up how much they long for Majaivana. “Golide (Majaivana) siyakudinga baba, woza kanye nje sikubone sithi fill up BF. Sayiwela sayiwela sayiwela ingulukudela siyofuna imali. Eish this man, kumbe kwasuka kwathini Golide. Woza baba kanye nje sigcwalise iCity Hall (Majaivana we need you, come down for just one show and we fill up Barbourfields Stadium),” Zondo commented on the documentary. Hopefully one day, Majaivana will come and give Zimbabweans a once-off show.
