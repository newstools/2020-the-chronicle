A FEW people knew about the queen of Amapiano, Zimbabwean musician, Shasha when she was billed to perform at the Bulawayo 2019 Shutdown gig in December last year. Most fans were looking forward to seeing South Africa’s Nasty C, Mafikizolo, Nadia Nakai and Zimbabwe’s Winky D, Mzoe 7, Asaph and Novuyo Seagirl. <img class="wp-image-461704 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Lee-McHoney-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Lee-McHoney-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Lee-McHoney-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lee McHoney When the Akulaleki hitmaker took to the stage to close up after the energetic Winky D, eyebrows were raised as to who Shasha is. Born in Bulawayo, Shasha is regarded as the success story of Zimbabwean music after she landed a nomination for the BET awards, a first for the country. <img class="wp-image-447142 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/unnamed-13-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/unnamed-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/unnamed-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Novuyo Seagirl Chronicle Showbiz spoke with Zimbabwean artistes based in Bulawayo on their experiences after rubbing shoulders with Shasha, one of their own. Afro-pop musician Mzoe 7 said giving entertainment to the same crowd with Shasha gave him a sense of belonging. <img class="wp-image-479438 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Msiz’Kay-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Msiz’Kay.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Msiz’Kay-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Msiz’Kay “We did not have much of a chat but just greetings. It always feels good sharing the stage with other African peers who are doing well. Shasha is an amazing performer, not just a singer but the whole package. “She has built herself up and the levels she has attained make many people proud to be Zimbabweans. Just to be nominated for the BET awards alone is a big achievement and I wish her all the best,” said Mzoe 7. For Zimbabwe’s hip hop king Asaph, meeting Shasha for the first time was a joy. <img class="wp-image-485166 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/mzoe7--680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/mzoe7-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/mzoe7--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mzoe 7 “I actually knew about Shasha while she was still in Zimbabwe. She’s very down to earth and I managed to chat with her on the very first day we met. We met at the gig for the first time and I loved every moment of it,” he said. Afro hip hop musician Msiz’Kay said: “It was a great experience. Shasha is such an amazing artistes and she is probably the only artiste based outside the country that I got to talk to. We chatted a bit and I told her that I am a big fan of her EP and she gave some advice about the industry and she was very professional as she gave me her management contacts.” For Zimbabwean female acts on the day, it was a different story as they were unable to engage the Tender Love hitmaker. House music songstress Novuyo Seagirl said unfortunately for her it was a bad day in office as she had wished to mingle with Shasha but failed to do so. “I love her music so much and I was really looking forward to at least mingling with her but failed. I heard from others that had a chance to engage her that she is cool. “Her performance was great and I enjoyed it,” said Novuyo Seagirl. Afro Fusion Lee McHoney said: “Unfortunately I didn’t get a chance to speak to her but I was inspired by her artistic energy.” — @mthabisi_mthire.
