WARRIOR combative midfielder Marvelous Nakamba might as well start considering offers from Turkish topflight side Trabzonspor, as his English Premiership side Aston Villa continues to slide deep into relegation. Villa lost 1-2 at home to former champions Chelsea on Sunday, with Nakamba coming on in the 70th minute for Courie Hourihane. Villa went into the break leading 1-0, but conceded two goals in two minutes just after the hour mark and by the time Nakamba was introduced, they were already trailing and the confidence with which they had displayed in the first half had been sniffed out. There was really nothing the Zimbabwe international could do to inspire his teammates, who seemed to have accepted their fate. Nakamba has made 26 appearances for Villa out of 30 games. He signed for Villa from Belgian side Club Brugge for â‚¬12 million last year and is under contract until June 2024. Reports say Trabzonspor are looking for a replacement for former Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel, who terminated his deal with the club in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The 26-year-old Nakamba is reportedly keen to move to the Turkish Super Liga table-toppers to play Champions League football next season. @ZililoR
