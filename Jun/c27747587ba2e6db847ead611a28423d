THE Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) has expressed concern over alleged violation of Covid-19 regulations by truck drivers as they bring grain into the country from South Africa. According to a document addressed to the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) dated June 8, seen by this paper, GMAZ said: “The association notes with appreciation your continued support in the provision of carriage of white maize from South Africa into our own GMAZ private silos in Bulawayo and Harare. “The Government of Zimbabwe has communicated its concerns to us with regards to the conduct of most of your truck drivers who tend to travel in pairs with the opposite gender outside the scope of their duties and also carry passengers for monetary benefits. “This conduct violates the exemption of the compulsory quarantine on these truck drivers granted by the Government of Zimbabwe.” GMAZ media and public relations manager Mr Garikai Chaunza said while the country critically requires the grain imports to address the national food security, the conduct of truck drivers cannot be tolerated as it militates against the efforts being made to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. “You are therefore, strongly directed to ensure that your drivers do not carry any other persons in their vehicles and must travel alone. Those drivers found in the company of other person(s), should be subjected to compulsory 21 days of quarantine and liable for prosecution,” said Mr Chaunza. CZI is yet to comment on the matter. Zimbabwe, which requires 1,8 million tonnes of grain annually, is importing maize from the region and around the globe as part of efforts to cover the deficit. In the last farming season, Zimbabwe did not harvest much due to drought induced by poor rains it received. — @okazunga
