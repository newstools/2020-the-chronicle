THE Shipping and Forwarding Agents Association of Zimbabwe (SFAAZ) has waived clearance costs for a week to cushion those importing equipment and accessories for use in the fight against Covid-19. The organisation’s board member, Ms Catherine Hlanguyo said the reprieve on importers will end on Friday this week. She made the remarks during the donations of 850 reusable masks to the Beitbridge Covid-19 Task Force and several others to members of the media last Friday. According to Ms Hlanguyo, the donations and the free services is part of efforts to complement measures being taken to fight the pandemic. Some of the common goods being imported through the borders are sanitisers, masks and synthetic gloves. Government has since scrapped import duty on these. Prior to the duty waiver, import duty on synthetic fibres (common gloves used in the country) were charged a 40 percent and an additional US$3 per kg plus 15 percent value added tax. The sanitisers were levied a 40 percent duty and 15 percent value added tax while face masks do not attract import duty. However, the value and quantities of these items, which come through Beitbridge could not be readily established. Ms Hlanguyo said some of their members had also offered assistance in various capacities to the country as a contribution to the national responsive efforts. “The Shipping and Forwarding Agents Association of Zimbabwe (SFAAZ), through some of its members, will be offering a free service to importers of Covid-19 related goods during the period from today to the 4th of June,” she said.
