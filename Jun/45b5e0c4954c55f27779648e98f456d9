The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent INKULULEKO Yabatsha School of Arts (Iyasa) is set to prove why they are one of the most sought-after groups and bring an enjoyable atmosphere tonight when they share the stage with Chase Skuza and Jah Prayzah tonight. The trio which has vowed to take people back into time and provide unique entertainment, is billed to perform at the Nash TV Friday Night Live show that will be shown on ZBCtv and on the ZTN and Nash TV Facebook pages as from 9:30PM. The inclusion of groups from Bulawayo on that platform which his growing with each week, has been commended by many, with many hailing the event’s organisers. Last week, South Africa’s afro-pop group was the headline act. The show which ended abruptly, was not received well by its viewers who pleaded with organisers to first exhaust local performances before inviting artistes from outside the country. And a week later, show organisers have clearly heeded that call by including artistes from outside Harare on their platform. Commenting on their performance tonight, Iyasa director Nkululeko Dube promised an action-packed performance that will take viewers back in time to the days of hit Banolila with Chase Skuza. “We are happy to have been presented with such a platform to share a stage with artistes whom we’ve worked with before on collaborations. It’s always good to find a platform to flex our creativity especially during these Covid-19 trying times,” said Dube. “It will be a good show as we always strive to put up our best. The new stage and big venue is now online and we’re more than pleased to introduce ourselves to multitudes of fans across the globe.” @mthabisi_mthire
