ZIFA has threatened Bulawayo Province executive members who include vice-chairman Allan Mpofu, Takawira Madza, Charles Ndlovu and Otrick Siziba with unspecified action if they don’t tender their resignation letters by today. Mpofu, Madza, Ndlovu and Siziba announced that they had quit the Bulawayo Province board last week following the reinstatement of provincial chairman Francis Ntutha by the Zifa national executive committee. Mpofu and his board members said they could not work with Ntutha until he is cleared of financial mismanagement allegations being levelled against him. Mpofu wrote to Zifa chief executive officer Joseph Mamutse furnishing him with the reasons for Ntutha’s suspension. In a letter dated June 15 and addressed to Mpofu in his capacity as the acting chairman, Mamutse said the association didn’t have their formal letters of resignation and were awaiting formal communication from all the members that announced their resignation through the media. <img class="wp-image-336826 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/Joseph-Mamutse.jpg" alt="" width="677" height="388" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/Joseph-Mamutse.jpg 677w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/Joseph-Mamutse-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/Joseph-Mamutse-305x175.jpg 305w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /> Joseph Mamutse Mamutse then wrote another letter on June 20 to Mpofu threatening them with unspecified action. “This is a follow up of our letter dated June 15, 2020, wherein we requested you to favour us with written letters of resignation from each member following your board resolution to resign on June 13, 2020. To date, we have not seen your official letters to communicate your decision as requested. Kindly be advised that your official letters of resignation should be submitted on or before 12 noon on June 22, 2020, failure of which necessary action will be taken against you,” wrote Mamutse. However, Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela told our sister paper Sunday News that the association had since accepted the quartet’s resignations and will, in the next two months hold elections to replace them. This is, however, contrary to Section 10 of article 32 of the Zifa constitution which clearly states that if more than 50 percent of the positions become vacant, the general secretary shall convene an extraordinary congress within two months in order to elect a replacement for the remaining term of mandate. The ‘replacement’ is not necessarily for those who would have resigned, but for all the positions.
