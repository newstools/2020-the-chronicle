CASSAVA Edutech has launched the Akello E-library, an online library platform aimed at offering hundreds of school curriculum books to strengthen Zimbabwe’s education sector by providing learners and teachers with easy access to a wide variety of Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (Zimsec) prescribed text books. The new product is set to offer convenience and accessibility through strategic partnerships with local publishers using a subscription model for library books, which is up to 90 percent affordable compared to printed books, said the company. The launch of the Akello E-library comes less than a month after the launch of the Akello digital classroom, which offers learners live online classes, as well as on-demand lesson videos after the live classes. “We are introducing the Akello E-Library platform to the market in order to offer convenience to learners and students who have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Mr Eddie Chibi, the chief executive officer of Cassava Smartech Zimbabwe, the holding company of Cassava Edutech. “With schools having been shut for a while and with the understandable uncertainty over their opening due to health and safety concerns, we still want students to achieve good grades and to excel, regardless of the schools they attend or their financial circumstance. “Through the Akello E-library we believe we are offering them a great platform to access vital academic textbooks for their study preparations,” he said. Akello Edutech chief operating officer Mr Tendai Mashingaidze said the Akello E-library, which houses books across various categories for all age groups – from ECD to Advanced Level – had partnered with various local publishers to scale and achieve maximum convenience for learners and educators. “Akello E-library has partnered with several publishers to offer a wide range of books, including Zimsec-approved curriculum education text books, Christian reading and many more,” said Mr Mashingaidze
