South Africa-based gospel music duo Wilson Dlamini and Sabelo Mabhena believe they were brought together to spread the Word of God and bring comfort to those in sorrow through their music. The two singers have released a second 15- track album Impilo Yami, that is available on all digital music stores. The album has songs such as Dlula la, Siphila Kufungwe, Amashumi, the title track Impilo Yami, UJesu Uyangithanda, Umthandazo, Uyabethelwa, Ezweni Hlala Nami, Ngokulandela Msindisi, Icebo lika Jehova, Sithethelele, Siyabonga, Duduzekani and Konke Kulungile. “We chose Gospel music because we want to spread the Word of God and comfort those who are in sorrow. We recorded the album Impilo Yami in February and it is about praising and worshipping God for what he has done,” said Dlamini. Dlamini attended Mthonisela Primary and Simbo Baba Secondary School in Skhobokhobo, Nkayi. He began his music career in 1997 and released his first album in 2000, which had the title track Ikhaya Elihle. Mabhena attended Mkoba Primary School and Nhlangano Secondary School in Lower Gweru. He started his music career in 2009 when he was part of a singing group from his local church, Seventh Day Adventist. The group called Sing Male recorded an album called Why Me. When he was in South Africa in 2017 at a place called Diepsloot, Mabhena recognised Dlamini from his album covers and he spoke to his future musical partner. This sparked talks for their first album UJehova Uyaphendula which did fairly well. Now with their second album they hope to continue in the vein of ministering the Word to people, through their music.
