The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent House musician Novuyo Seagirl has collaborated with up-and-coming Harare-based afro-pop musician Harmony for a series of love songs. The duo recently released their first single titled Sorry Kwacho which is now available on YouTube. The song which was produced by Cymplex Music is about a love affair where one of the partners constantly wrongs his lover and covers his tracks by hiding behind the word sorry. The woman, knowing her man’s tendencies, is fed up with the apologies. Speaking from his base in Harare, Harmony said he was excited about his partnership with Novuyo. “This song is the beginning of new things as I’m going to be working with Novuyo Seagirl on a series of singles. The singles will mostly focus on love,” Harmony said. Novuyo Seagirl who was introduced to Harmony by a friend said they clicked very well from the onset which made working together simple. She said Sorry Kwacho was the first of many singles set to be produced by the two. “This is a great song and it got me out of my comfort zone as I’d never done an afro pop track. We jelled so well and it was quite fun working on the song. I can safely say the future is bright.” The Aeiou hit-maker said fans should look out for the reply of the song in the coming months. @mthabisi_mthire
