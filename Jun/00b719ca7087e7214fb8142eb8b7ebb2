The Chronicle Business Reporter THE African Development Bank (AfDB) Bureau of the Boards of Governors has issued a communique clarifying the whistle blower complaint against the president of the bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina. This follows the governors’ meeting on the 4th of June 2020 over the matter regarding alleged unethical conduct by Dr Adesina over awarding of some contracts. Earlier reports by some sections of the international media had insinuated perceived bias and suggested that Dr Adesina was facing a new probe. However, in its communique, signed by chair of the Bureau of the Board of Governors, Ms Niale Kaba, the bank explained that the decision by the board was not to open a new inquiry but, instead, to have an independent review of the Ethics Committee’s report on the matter. The Bureau of Governors decided that rather than a new and fresh independent investigation, it would only “authorize an independent review of the Report of the Ethics Committee of the Boards of Directors relative to the allegations considered by the Ethics Committee and the submissions made by the president of the bank group thereto in the interest of due process”. The Bureau reiterated that it agrees that the Ethics Committee performed its role in this matter in accordance with the applicable rule under Resolution B/BG 2008/11 of the Board of Governors. However, based on the views of some governors on the matter and the need to carry every governor along in resolving it, the Bureau resolved to authorise an independent review, said Ms Kaba. She said the independent review would be conducted by a “neutral, high calibre individual with unquestionable experience” within a short time period of not more than two to four weeks, taking into account the group’s electoral calender. “The Bureau agrees that within a three to six month period and following the independent review of the Ethics Committee report, an independent comprehensive review of the implementation of the bank group’s whistle blowing and complaints handling policy should be conducted with a view to ensuring that the policy is properly implemented and reviewing it where necessary, to avoid situations of the same nature in future,” reads the communique.
