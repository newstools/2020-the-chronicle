COMBATIVE midfielder Winston Mhango has signed a three-month contract extension with Zambian topflight side Kabwe Warriors up to the end of August. The former FC Platinum midfielder’s two-year contract had expired on May 23 and Kabwe Warriors extended his stay, as the Zambian League is set to resume next month. “I’ve just signed a short-term contract extension with a clause that l’m free to leave when l want to because there is no signing on fee. Remember, our season is still to end and we are yet to resume play, meaning that there are no possible deals to pursue. I’ll look at available offers once the season ends,” Mhango said.
