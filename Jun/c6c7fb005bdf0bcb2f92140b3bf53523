A BULILIMA man fatally stabbed his friend for refusing to pay him after he had won a $10 bet in a card game. Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson, Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the incident which occurred at Ntoli Business Centre on Thursday last week at around 5PM. He said the suspect Delani Ndlovu (28) stabbed Oscar Moyo (29) with an Okapi knife in the stomach and chest. “I can confirm that we recorded a murder case which occurred at Ntoli Business Centre in Bulilima. Delani Ndlovu and Oscar Moyo were playing a game of cards when they had a misunderstanding over an undisclosed issue. They started fighting and Ndlovu drew an okapi knife and stabbed Moyo in the chest and stomach. “Moyo was rushed to a nearby clinic where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. Ndlovu is still at large and we appeal to anyone with information that could lead to his arrest to contact the nearest police station. As police we continue to urge people to desist from engaging in violence during disputes. People should also desist from carrying dangerous weapons in public. These weapons have been the cause of a number of violent crimes of which some result in the loss of life,” he said. Chief Insp Ndebele also urged members of the public to desist from engaging in illegal activities such as gambling. A source close to the investigations who preferred anonymity said Ndlovu and Moyo were playing a game of cards and had each placed a $10 bet. He said Ndlovu won and Moyo refused to pay up resulting in the altercation. The source said when other villagers intervened, Ndlovu had already stabbed Moyo and fled from the scene. — @DubeMatutu.
