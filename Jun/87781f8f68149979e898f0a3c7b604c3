FLEA market traders in Victoria Falls have resumed business after the municipality allowed them back to their vending stalls. Informal traders such as curio vendors and flea market operators are some of the businesses that were closed because of the global Covid-19 pandemic. Some were now operating from their homes, displaying clothes on verandas for sale, resulting in raids by municipal police. A survey by a Chronicle news crew during the week showed that the Victoria Falls Municipality (VFM)-owned Chinotimba Flea Market is now open while Comesa Market, a private facility popularly known as Emaplankeni, has been opened to those running shops, while vending stalls remain closed. Curio vendors are yet to open probably because their major customers are tourists. Flea market traders said while they are happy to be back, business is very low as there are few customers. “I started on Monday but as you can see business is very low. We are displaying stuff that we had ordered between December and January and we can’t restock now since the borders are closed. The tourism industry is closed because of Covid-19 hence people’s buying power is next to zero,” said Ms Gugulethu Sibanda, who sells a variety of clothes. Chinotimba Flea Market chairman Mr Trynos Taruvinga said the majority of vendors are still struggling to raise $265 which is needed upfront for annual licence renewal as well as rent which is pegged at $331 per month per stall. <img class="wp-image-502024 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Mr-Trynos-Taruvinga-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Mr-Trynos-Taruvinga.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Mr-Trynos-Taruvinga-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Trynos Taruvinga “About 37 of the more than 60 members have managed to come back while some are still struggling with licence renewal and money to restock. We are back because of hunger. People couldn’t sell at home because they were being raided by authorities,” said Mr Taruvinga. He appealed to Government to consider them when giving out grants, saying none of their members had benefited so far. Each vendor is encouraged to wear a mask and have a sanitiser. VFM Housing and Community Services director Mr Brian Nyamande said they had fumigated the market places. “Yes, we have since allowed traders in the informal sector to return to the market but the conditions are that we had to fumigate and disinfect the premises before re-opening. They are under stringent control and guidance of our public health and social services teams as we try to enforce social distancing and other regulations,” said Mr Nyamande. He said the local authority, together with the Covid-19 taskforce which he chairs in Victoria Falls, considered the economic plight of vendors who had been out of business since start of the lockdown in March. The disinfection exercise was done last week. Mr Nyamande said they will be strictly monitoring for adherence to guidelines such as social distancing and sanitising of hands. “We have put in place sanitisation and other public health measures and hope all will go well. Our main thrust is to strike a balance between health and economic viability of these people whose livelihoods are entirely dependent on vending,” said Mr Nyamande. — @ncubeleon
