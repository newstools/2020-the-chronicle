THE Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) is set to hold a virtual executive meeting today aimed at mapping the way forward for the game post Covid-19. The BVA season was set to get underway on March 21 with the traditional pre-season opener at Milton High School before all sporting activities were suspended by the rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. While the Government has given the greenlight for low risk sports to resume activities, volleyball is placed under high risk sports that are still on lockdown. Sports and recreation activities have been classified into three different categories, high risk, medium risk and low risk, with all contact sports being classified under high risk. Football, wrestling, boxing, basketball, waterpolo, taekwondo, rugby, netball, judo, handball and field hockey are all classified as high risk. BVA chairperson William Mazviro said they’ll have a better picture of the direction to take after today’s meeting. The meeting is set to look at precautionary measures the association should take to ensure players make a safe return to the game. As a result BVA intends to run three parallel leagues, junior, corporate and premier league. The junior league will serve as a platform for player development, with the corporate league coming in as a social event. BVA also enlisted various committees into its structures as it seeks to make it’s brand more marketable and reach out to stakeholders more effectively. Joseph Dzimati heads the referees’ commission, with Nozinhle Khumalo taking up the role of players’ commission chairperson. Emmanuel Matirongo leads the marketing commission, while Nomusa Moyo heads the gender commission. — @innocentskizoe
