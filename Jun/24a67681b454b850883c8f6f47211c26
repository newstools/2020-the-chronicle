The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BENEFICIARIES of foodstuffs donated by former Warriors captain Benjani Mwaruwari expressed gratitude to the ex-Manchester City forward, saying the hampers came at the right time when prices of basic commodities have shot beyond their reach. Through his Benjani Mwaruwari Foundation and associates, the ex-Zimbabwe international donated foodstuffs to 900 families in Old Magwegwe and gave 30 hampers to Highlanders and Entembeni Old People’s Home to cushion them against effects of the Covid-19 lockdown. The donation, worth $540 000, saw each recipient receiving a 10kg bag of maize meal, 750ml of cooking oil and a 500-gramme packet of sugar beans. Speaking on behalf of the Old Magwegwe residents, Cleopas Phiri, said: “Benjy has always been helping the needy in our community and we really appreciate the efforts he continues to make by remembering us. We really appreciate his gesture. You know with prices of mealie-meal skyrocketing and selling at R100 for a 10kg bag on the black market, this donation has really come at the right time to cushion us. May God bless Benjy and his family who made sure the foodstuffs are distributed fairly.” Zulu Chiefs, a social football club from Marisha in Old Magwegwe, which Mwaruwari plays for whenever he is in the country from his England base, also received foodstuffs. Highlanders chairman Kenneth Mhlophe said it was pleasing to note that Mwaruwari, who played for the club’s juniors, still remembered his roots. “At a time when things are tight in every sector, we appreciate all the assistance we get to cushion players and staff. We’re grateful to Mwaruwari and we hope this gesture will challenge more people to assist the club in kind as well as the community,” said Mhlophe. – @ZililoR
