The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma in Mafa village, Bulilima
Rhumba outfit Mokis Connection have not enjoyed the benefits of their popularity despite boasting of more than 15 albums. The outfit bankrolled by popular cross border transport operator Morgan ‘Moki’ Ncube was formed in 1998 in the bushy areas of Mafa village in Bulilima district under Chief Madlambudzi. They have more than 15 albums to their name and some of their popular songs include Irene, Marvelous, Fumwa Yatate, Isifiso Sami and Julia. The group is very popular in Matabeleland South and neighbouring South Africa but this popularity has sadly not translated to benefits. The group has not been paid their royalties for the past 25 years despite their songs enjoying airplay at many radio stations. Chronicle Showbiz caught up with Moki at his village in Mafa on Sunday to find out the challenges facing his group. Moki said the major challenge was non-payment of their royalities by the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura). Zimura is supposed to collect royalties on behalf of musicians. “We’ve been in the game for more than a decade and our major challenge is non-payment of royalties by Zimura. We are yet to be paid royalties despite that we have 15 albums whose songs are enjoying airplay on radio stations, “said Moki. He said he had engaged Zimura on several occasions without success. “Officials at the Zimura offices are giving us excuses for non-payment of the royalties which we believe they were paid on our behalf,” said Moki.-@mthabisi_mthire.
