ZIMBABWE Soccer Coaches Association (Zisca) Bulawayo says it has had an overwhelming response to its online programme called Meet the Yesteryear Players. The programme is aimed at enriching local coaches through interaction with legends of the game. In the programme, former players talk about changes to the game by comparing their playing time and the present day game on the Zisca digital platform. Esrom Nyandoro and Ronald Gidiza Sibanda are among legends of the local game that have already taken part in the programme since its launch last month. Nyandoro, who was the first guest, gave the coaches insight into how best they can pluck a leaf from South African Premiership side Mamelodi Sundowns’ development structure. Sibanda indicated that the major difference between yesteryear players and the current crop was that the modern game lacked passion. He said the game was driven more by money than anything else. FC Platinum assistant coach Lizwe Sweswe will be the next guest on the Zisca platform today. Zisca Bulawayo committee member Joseph Nkomazana said the programme has been hugely beneficial to the coaches. “The sessions have actually been quite insightful and our coaches are learning a lot from the legends we have invited so far. We are committed to ensuring that the province produces good quality coaches. The response from both aspiring and seasoned coaches has been really amazing. Coaches are supporting the programme, especially the young coaches. They are learning from these discussions,” said Nkomazana. He said plans were underway to invite female coaches and legends to the programme. Meet the Yesteryear Players is one of the many projects the association is organising in an endeavour to empower and equip local coaches.
