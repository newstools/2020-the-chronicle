ALL is set for the Anti-Sanctions Virtual Gala taking place tonight with artistes from across the country converging in Bulawayo to call for the removal of the embargo by the West while showcasing their talent. Last year, Sadc declared October 25 as Anti-Sanctions Day and the virtual gala is part of activities that Zimbabwe has lined up this month. <img class="wp-image-452585 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Untitled-7-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Untitled-7-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Untitled-7-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sandra Ndebele Zimbabwe has been under illegal sanctions for the past 20 years following the successful land reform exercise at the turn of the millennium.

We all want to live better lives and we call for them to go,” said Jeys Marabini. Nkululeko Dube, the director of Iyasa said beyond sanctions, Zimbabwe is a beautiful country whose potential needs to be realised. “It’s important that we send the message out there about Anti-Sanctions, because Zimbabwe is a beautiful country and we believe that beyond sanctions, we can become the breadbasket of Africa,” said Dube. Mzoe 7 said he was behind the Government’s Anti-Sanctions drive as an artiste as he wants a better life for the nation. “We thank the Ggovernment for involving the artistes in helping spread the message of Anti-Sanctions. We’re the best people to communicate with society and tell the message. We wish to see the best for our country as we all want a better life. “We hope the message will be understood by everyone,” said Mzoe7, before promising the virtual audience a performance of their lifetime that will feature a full band and dancers. – @bonganinkunzi
