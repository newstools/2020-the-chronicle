REGISTRATION for the Econet Victoria Falls Virtual Marathon has been set at a flat fee of R100 or US$6 for all races. Registration for the 7.5km fun run, 21km two-person relay, 21.1km half marathon and 42.2km full marathon on December 13 is currently underway. Once one registers for the race, they will access an “interactive real-time tracking software currently available to runners”. Those that register for the competition can start using the tracking system during their preparations for the event. “All you need to be able to compete is a smart phone. We have set up a simple ‘how it works’ flow diagram from entering to claiming your profile via the app to run with. “There is plenty of time to practice in advance and test the app and even plan your race day route, so that on race day you will be ready,” said Wild Frontiers, the event organisers. Wild Frontiers has been hailed for its decision to hold a virtual race this year, a move likely to attract more participants from around the globe. Organisers first moved the premier event from July to December due to outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, but still with the Government cautiously relaxing restrictions and not allowing resumption of sporting competitions, they decided to make it virtual. The marathon draws international participants and traditionally takes place on the first week of July. In a virtual marathon, athletes register and pay the requisite amount for their preferred distance then run on the set date at their own time and along their own chosen route. Athletes record the finishing time and upload it on the race website and get certificates of participation which they can print. The Victoria Falls Marathon will have an interactive ‘live’ tracking and distances will be timed with results provided. Prizes and giveaways are still being negotiated with the sponsors. “You can challenge your friends, family and running clubs,” said Wild Frontiers. — @ZililoR
