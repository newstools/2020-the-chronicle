The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief
A 49-YEAR-OLD man from Sikombingo Village in Lower Gweru in the Midlands Province has been arrested for allegedly impregnating his 15-year-old stepdaughter after raping her three times. Each time his wife, the victim’s mother, was away, the accused would sneak into the bedroom where the complainant slept with her other siblings before raping her. In one of the counts, one of the siblings woke up to relieve herself and allegedly witnessed her father raping the complainant. Each time the accused raped the complainant, he allegedly threatened her with death if she dared report the rape to anyone. When the complainant’s mother discovered the pregnancy, she allegedly lied that her boyfriend was responsible as she feared being killed by the accused. This was heard when the accused appeared before Gweru regional magistrate Mrs Phathekile Msipa facing three counts of rape. The accused who has pleaded guilty to just one count, was remanded out of custody to October 27 for continuation of trial. Mr Talent Tadenyika is representing the State.
