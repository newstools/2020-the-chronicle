VICTORIA Falls is set to get a second state-of-the-art Information Communication Technology (ICT) hub after a leading hospitality group, Love for Africa donated the facility. The solar-powered ICT hub whose construction is expected to be completed by December, is expected to cost between US$320 000 and US$400 000 and will be located at Mosi-oa-Tunya High School. A ground breaking ceremony to mark the start of construction work was done on Monday. Love for Africa in partnership with First Lady Amai Auxilia Mnangagwaâ€™s Angel of Hope Foundation and other partners donated the facility. State-owned TelOne will provide Wi-Fi services supported by Telco which is already providing the school with internet services. The facility will be the second in Victoria Falls following a model education innovation hub donated by Love for Africa and Angel of Hope, which the First Lady commissioned at Victoria Falls Primary School in July last year.
Besides the two in Victoria Falls, a similar facility is being constructed in Harare and another one at Main Camp in Hwange National Park. Representing Love for Africa, Mr Blessing Munyenyiwa said construction work at Mosi-oa-Tunya will be completed before year end with the facility expected to be commissioned in January next year. He said new technology material and equipment imported from America will be used to construct and furnish the facility.
