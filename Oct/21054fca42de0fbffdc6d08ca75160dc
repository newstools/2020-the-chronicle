MINING sector workers have been awarded a 22 percent wage increase, which will see the lowest paid employee for the period October to December 2020, earning a basic salary of ZWL$18 000. Previously, the lowest paid was earning a basic of ZWL$14 750 as at September 30, 2020. The increase follows a recent agreement between the Associated Mine Workers Union of Zimbabwe (AMWUZ) and the Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe. According to a joint circular released by AMWUZ and the Chamber of Mines this Tuesday, the increase is based on the dollar value principle for those mines that maybe paying above the minimum due to various reasons or merit. “The portion payable in US$ shall be converted to ZWL$ at the prevailing interbank exchange at the time of payment and deducted from the respective minimum wage to determine the balance to be paid in local currency. “For clarity, the total earnings for each grade will be equal to the respective minimum for that grade,” reads part of the circular. – @okazunga.
