The Chronicle Former Polokwane City forward Walter Musona is being assessed by Baroka FC. The younger brother of ex-Kaizer Chiefs star Knowledge Musona was part of the Rise and Shine team that was relegated to the GladAfrica Championship last season. Musona played a total of 14 matches for Polokwane in the last campaign, scoring one goal. The 24-year-old Zimbabwean, who can also play as a left-winger, joined Johnny Mogaladi’s side from FC Platinum in 2017 following a stint with Slovakian football club FK Senica. “I’m training with Baroka FC now, at the moment I’m still just training,” Musona tells KickOff.com. “I’m not sure for how long or for how many days but I’m training there. But ya, everything is okay this side. I hope I sign because I need to play in the PSL.” Bakgaga assistant coach Matsemela Thoka is currently in charge of the training sessions following the suspension of head coach Dylan Kerr.
