The Chronicle STEVE Komphela has resigned from Lamontville Golden Arrows to take up a position of senior coach at Mamelodi Sundowns, he has confirmed via a statement. Experienced coach Komphela leaves Golden Arrows just two weeks before the start of the new season, and will work alongside Sundowns head coaches Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena at Chloorkop. It appears to be, for all intents and purposes, an assistant coach role, but has been given a different title given Komphela’s seniority in the game. “I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Chairperson of Lamontville Golden Arrows, Mato Madlala, and to Golden Arrows FC for their support and encouragement to me whilst I was head coach,” Komphela said. “I have been given an exciting opportunity to join Mamelodi Sundowns as Senior Coach and to work with joint head coaches Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena. “I look forward to this exciting challenge and hope to contribute to the growth and success of Mamelodi Sundowns in South Africa and on the African continent.” Komphela joined Golden Arrows in December 2018 after making a sudden switch from Bloemfontein Celtic. He spent almost three seasons at Kaizer Chiefs before that, and also had successful spells with Free State Stars and Maritzburg United. — SuperSport
