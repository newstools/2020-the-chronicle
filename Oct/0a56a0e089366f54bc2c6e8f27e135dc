Yashar Productions, an arts ensemble of teenagers which specialises in dance, theatre and film has vowed to change the game on the arts scene. The Bulawayo-based Christian-oriented company which mostly focuses on dance said it wants to tell stories that resonate with the people through its craft. Watching the group rehearse its productions last week, one could tell that the crew is passionate and is on a mission to change the game. Their dances and theatrical performances will definitely leave people spellbound. Yashar Productions spokesperson Joseph Kapitango said they are aiming to win souls, touch lives and unlock hidden talent and potential through creative arts. “Yashar means God the Just One. We want to penetrate the arts scene using different art forms including film, dance, theatre, music and poetry,” said Kapitango. As a group that is rooted in Christian values, with its members being congregants of Prophet Chiza’s Eagle Life church, Kapitango said they drew inspiration from their church leader through his encouragement and spiritual motivation. He said they also owe their formation to businesswoman Providence Moyo.
