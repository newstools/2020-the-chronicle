SOUTH Africa-based Maskandi artiste, Zinjaziyaluma has finally set a date when he will launch his ninth album. The event has been slated for November 14 at Underground Hillbrow Theatre in Johannesburg. He is expected to put out a show-stopping performance meant to hype the album. Zinjaziyaluma told Chronicle Showbiz in February that he was to launch the album in March before the Covid-19 pandemic which saw borders close and live shows being banned. Speaking from South Africa, Zinjaziyaluma said he will keep the title of the album a secret in order to create a buzz towards the launch. “The album will be released on November 14 and the title will be released a week before the launch as we want to keep it a surprise for our fans to hype up the album. “There are nine tracks among them Ukhetha Abanjani, Bavukela Emsebenzini, Ama2k and Lalani Kahle which is dedicated to musicians from our homeland who have died in South Africa, like Chapies who died in December last year and Mkhushulwa who died last month,” he said. Zinjaziyaluma said once events in Zimbabwe are given the greenlight to be held, he will bring the launch to the country. “Obviously as borders have started to be opened, I’ll come to Zimbabwe and give my fans a live taste of the album and that’s if live shows are back. “For now, I’m planning on also virtualising the launch here in South Africa so as not to leave behind the people who have made me become the artiste I am,” said Zinjaziyaluma. He added that he has started working on the visuals for the album with promos to be out by end of this month. “People should expect songs with style, dance songs, love songs, emotional songs and one gospel song,” said Zinjaziyaluma. The artiste has eight albums under his belt namely Kobandayo, Itraffic, Don’t jump the steps, Competition of Jealous, Icelebrity lomgunyathi, Igama lentandane, Ezweni lokhokho and UBulawayo. — Follow on Twitter @mthabisi_mthire.
