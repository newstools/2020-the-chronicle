ALL the ground work for the establishment of the Ponel Youth Soccer Academy (PYSA) in Dete, Hwange, has been done with the launch of the academy set for early next year. The academy is the brainchild of Zifa Matabeleland North executive member Nelson Ndeka. The idea behind PYSA is to promote, teach and develop the game of soccer within the Dete community as well as provide a quality programmes at the lowest possible cost to the participants. PYSA will also promote and encourage the ideas of sportsmanship and the principles of fair play. Ndeka said he came up with PYSA project after realising that vast talent was being lost to alcoholism and drugs because of lack of opportunities for the youngsters. “My passion for the beautiful game is the main reason I have started this project. I was a football player as a youngster but my father insisted that I should prioritise education more than anything hence I never excelled as a player. “However, I felt I still had something to contribute in football that is why I got into football structures and now I have come up with this project. “The goal is to provide an opportunity for enjoyment and recreation through competition for all boys and girls who voluntarily participate in such a programme that develops the community through soccer,” said Ndeka. He also said the academy was learning from premier league teams such as Bulawayo Chiefs in their quest to become one of the best talent hubs in the country. “We are taking lessons from other football clubs especially Bulawayo Chiefs who have inspired us to sell our own branded regalia. “We now have in stock branded face masks and golf t-shirts for sale. Place your order today and get the merchandise delivered to you,” he said
