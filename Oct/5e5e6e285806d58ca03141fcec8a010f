The congress saw Hajij Bouchra being elected as the 5th President of the CAVB to become the first female head of the continental body. Ndlovu ammased 37 votes compared to South Africa’s Sundrasagren Reddy who attained 11 votes. Ndlovu carries with him a wealth of experience which ranges from being president of the zone, secretary general and also Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) president. His sport adminstrative foundations were nurtured and perfected when he started off as the chairman of the Bulawayo Volleyball Association then named the Matabeleland Volleyball Association as it embraced the other two Matabeleland provinces. ZVA president Ringisai Mapondera said Ndlovu’s appointment was set to benefit Zimbabwe volleyball. “We are elated with this appointment as it challenges the nation to raise the bar in the development of the sport of volleyball,” he said.
