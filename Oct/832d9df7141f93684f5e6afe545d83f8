SOUTHERN Region clubs affiliated to Bulawayo and Matabeleland North Provinces’ Futsal league say they are in the dark about the Fifa Covid-19 bailout funds. Zifa started disbursing part of the US$1,5 million relief package availed by world soccer governing body in July. In their revised schedule of distribution of funds, Zifa gave Futsal US$10 000. Matabeleland North has been running a Futsal league with six teams and these are Black Rock, Iwisa, Makwika, Kamandama, FC Zambezi and Power Dynamos. The Bulawayo league, which plays at the Fifa Grassroots Centre in Gwabalanda, is made up of 2019 champions Bulawayo Artists United, Flying Stars, Fox FC, Cash Money FC, Amabhubesi FC, Street Set FC and Killmanock FC. Chance Moyo, Bulawayo league vice-chairman said: “We’re in the dark about the Covid-19 relief funds. Nothing has been said to us about how they’ll be distributed or if we are going to get anything.” Questions were raised about how some affiliates were allocated funds yet they have not been running any known competitions. Beach Soccer was given US$10 000, the same amount as Area Zones. Naph and Nash each got US$5 000. Clive Mwale, the Matabeleland North Futsal chairman, said they are still waiting for Zifa to communicate its position. Zifa spokesperson Xolisani Gwesela has previously indicated that amounts deposited were according to the schedule. – @ZililoR
