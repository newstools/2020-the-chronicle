LOW-COST airline, Fastjet Zimbabwe, says it will re-introduce flights between Victoria Falls International Airport and OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa in December. The new service would enhance connectivity to one of the country’s prime resort destinations following reopening of the skies since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country early this year. Recently, Fastjet announced the resumption of regional flights between Bulawayo and Johannesburg following the lifting of the Covid-19 pandemic-induced travel restrictions between Zimbabwe and South Africa. In a statement, Fastjet Zimbabwe said the flight schedule for the planned route was now on with set fare prices. “Fastjet Zimbabwe is pleased to announce the re-introduction of flights between Victoria Falls International Airport and Johannesburg, OR Tambo International Airport from Thursday 3 December 2020. “The new flight schedule will operate three times per week between the two cities on a Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.”
