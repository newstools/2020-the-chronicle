THE second edition of the ZimStars Awards is expected to be held virtually next month with the country’s talented and fast-rising artistes and personalities set to be honoured. This year’s nominees list is quite refreshing as it is filled with new faces, from musicians, actors, dancers, producers to online television stations. Not only does it have new names, it is balanced as outstanding artistes from all corners of the country have been included. In the music category, notable among the nominees is high flying Jah Master, Asaph, Poptain, Allanah, Van Choga, Vuyo Brown, Tebza, Sikhosana, Mzoe 7 and Novuyo Seagirl. Up-and-coming hip-hop musician Boy Nino, who expressed his dismay after not getting a nomination at the Bulawayo Arts Awards, finally got the recognition he was yearning for as he is nominated in the Best Newcomer category as well as Outstanding Music Video. Fast-growing online television stations ZTN, Onvi and Nash TV are also nominated. The first edition of the ZimStars awards was held virtually in February this year with artistic work from 2019 being recognised. Founded by Tinashe Mandlokuwa, a 19-year-old boy from Gweru who is studying film and television production at College of Creative Arts Africa, the awards seek to raise awareness countrywide about the importance of arts in the economy. Mandlokuwa said the awards are aimed at uplifting the country’s artistes. “ZimStars Arts Awards recognise achievements of outstanding Zimbabwean creatives and their work in the arts and culture industry. The awards serve to recognise passionate men and women who have diverse skills and talents in this field. “The awards are mainly focused on uplifting the youth and creatives in Zimbabwe and in the diaspora, to show appreciation and support to the young creatives,” said Mandlokuwa. He said the awards ceremony will be held in November on a date yet to be announced. <img class="wp-image-428578 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Nutty-O-new.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="414" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Nutty-O-new.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Nutty-O-new-360x219.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nutty O Voting has already begun and is expected to close on November 5.
