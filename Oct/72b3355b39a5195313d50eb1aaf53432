GOSPEL musician Sis Thoe has collaborated with Light Machine Gun (LMG) choir member, Happiness Sibanda, in a song which denounces sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the United States. The song titled Our beautiful Zimbabwe is in solidarity with the Sadc declaration of October 25 as Anti-Sanctions Day. Speaking during rehearsals on Wednesday, Sis Thoe (real name Tholakele Ndlovu), who is billed to perform at the Anti-Sanctions gala taking place in Bulawayo tomorrow, said she will perform the song there for the first time. She said she was inspired to work on the track because of her love for the country. “I’m proudly Zimbabwean and no matter how hard things are, I’ll always raise our flag high as I love my country. With this song, I’m trying to send a message to people that in life, there’s a time to cry and one to be happy. “But at the end of the day, Zimbabwe is our country and we all have a role to play in praying for the nation. Thus, we must support President Mnangagwa’s call for the removal of sanctions,” Sis Thoe said. She said if those who imposed sanctions were to lift them, the country’s economy would bloom, and hence why it is important for all Zimbabweans to take interest in the Anti-Sanctions Day. “If America would take away these sanctions, God would bless them as they would have made us a free country, something which will see us regain our economic power.” Hailing from Bulilima District, Sis Thoe’s music career dates back to 2007 when she formed a gospel group called Amakholwa Amahle. The group has to date, recorded two albums and a DVD. Under her solo brand, Sibanda has recorded four albums, three singles and two DVDs. – @mthabisi_mthire.
