The Chronicle Al Ahly have reportedly offered coach Pitso Mosimane a salary in the region of R54 million per annum, excluding winning bonuses. Mosimane has resigned from Sundowns and is set to become the first black African or non-Egyptian coach to lead the eight-time continental champions. Reports have emerged that Ahly may have tabled an offer in the region of US$120 000 (around R2 million) per month for the services of the former Bafana Bafana coach. This would easily double the Soweto-born coach’s current Sundowns salary, which was believed to be in the region of R800 000 and R1 million per month, including winning bonuses, when he penned a new four-year deal back in May. However, KickOff.com has now learnt from an impeccable source that the new debit order set to bolster Mosimane’s bank account could actually be closer to US$270 000 (R4.5 million) per month, excluding winning bonuses. Sources in Egypt have indicated that Ahly would certainly not be offering Mosimane anything less than US$100 000, with the staggering US$270 000 offer significantly more than former coach Rene Weiler was earning, which was reportedly around US$166 000 monthly.
