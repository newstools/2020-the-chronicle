NOW in its fifth year, the annual Beitbridge Mayor’s Half Marathon has been slated for the end of next month with registration for would-be-participants now open. A brainchild of the Beitbridge Town Council in conjunction with the Beitbridge Athletics Club, the Mayor’s Half Marathon was mooted to raise awareness among the public on littering. The first ran was held on 30 July 2016. This year’s race will, however, be held late into the year on 28 November. “The theme of the race is always centred around issues to deal with littering and this year is no different. “With the large number of travellers that pass through the border town on a daily basis littering has over the years became a major problem that we are face as the Beitbridge Town Council,” said Loud Ramakpapola, a member of the race organising team. The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic early this year has seen few travellers passing through Beitbridge Border Post after authorities imposed a national lockdown and closed borders to slow the spread of the virus. However, with the imminent phased reopening of land borders, the number of travellers passing through the country’s entry points will skyrocket. The Beitbridge Mayor’s Half Marathon includes a 25km main event, a 15km race as well as a 5km fun walk, which has over the years attracted significant crowds that include fitness enthusiasts. — @RaymondJaravaza
