From rhumba, hip-hop, afro-jazz to contemporary music is the diversity shown by this year’s RoilBAA nominations for the outstanding male artiste. The nominees are Madlela Skhobokhobo, Asaph, Msiz’Kay, Vusa Mkhaya and Hwabaraty. All the nominees have said they are very humbled by the nomination which is a confirmation that the fans are appreciating their works. Madlela Skhobokhobo said: “It’s a great honour and I’m delighted that I have three nominations. For the past three years my record speaks for itself and it’s actually out there for everyone to see. I’ve done big shows with great artistes that include Macheso and Jah Prayzah and I have been appointed brand ambassador for many companies. I also did one of the biggest movies in this country, Shaina and I think that justifies my nomination. Winning the award will be a blessing for me and my family, especially my youngest kid, Kganya Nomandla who is two weeks old,” said Madlela. Zimbabwe’s rap king Asaph said the Outstanding Male artiste category is the one he is looking forward to win. “I’m excited about the awards given that 2020 has been a difficult year but artistes still put in a lot of work. The one I’ve got my eye on is Best Male Artiste because I feel I’ve really worked hard and also represented the city on national charts,” said Asaph. Hwabaraty said he is putting his recent controversy with social media comedian Mai Titi behind as he focuses on winning the award. “It’s always inspiring to see my name on the list of those nominated, to me being nominated is a win already. “This year I’m on the peak as I’ve done many projects and collaborations. Thanks to the fans who nominated me as I wouldn’t have come to this level without their support. In the event I win, the win will be theirs,” he said. <img class="wp-image-449264 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/43248196_1904762572903880_5450957945581862912_n-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/43248196_1904762572903880_5450957945581862912_n-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/43248196_1904762572903880_5450957945581862912_n-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Msiz’kay Msiz’Kay said: “It feels good to be nominated for Best Male Artiste in this year’s awards given that the year has been very challenging for artistes. It is encouraging to learn that our efforts are being recognised. I managed despite the challenges to produce a single, Ngawuzw’ Umoya Wami which is very popular in the country right now. I was fortunate to collaborate with numerous other artistes on chart topping hits.” Speaking from his base in Austria, Vusa Mkhaya said he is grateful to be nominated which shows people are enjoyng his music. “I am very pleased that fans are recognising my works from the latest album. If I win I’ll dedicate the award to all the artistes in Bulawayo who continued to work hard despite the Covid-19 pandemic challenges,” said Vusa Mkhaya. —Follow on Twitter -@mthabisi_mthire.
