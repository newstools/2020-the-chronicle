South Africa-based Zimbabwean gospel musician Canaan Nyathi is stunned after being nominated in three categories of the prestigious Sabc Crown Gospel Awards. His hit song Baba Ziveze is nominated for Best Gospel Song of the Year alongside Bucy Radebe’s Uzuyigcin’Impilo Yam; Esphambanweni by Kelly Khumalo featuring Dr Hlengiwe Mhlaba; Xolisa Kwinana’s Uyasondla and Yibanathi by Vusi Nova featuring Dumi Mkokstad. For Best Gospel Artiste of the Year, Nyathi will be locking horns with his best friend Dumi Mkokstad, Dr Hlengiwe Mhlaba and Tebogo Moloi. He is also nominated for best Engineered Album courtesy of his 2019 live DVD recording; Another Level of Grace Upon Grace. Speaking from his base in Johannesburg, Nyathi who has performed alongside the likes of Ayanda Ntanzi, the late Neyi Zimu and Dr Tumi, revealed that he still cannot believe the nominations. He said it is all God’s grace for him to receive such an honour adding that the Baba Ziveze song has become a fulfilled testimony. “I’m honestly surprised by the nominations. It’s like coming from nothing to a level where your name is called among the greatest gospel musicians in Africa. This is all God’s doing. I called Him in my life and He is continuing to bless me abundantly,” said Nyathi. As he is nominated with Mkokstad in two categories clashing, Nyathi said he is grateful for the challenge. “Dumi is one of the closest people in my life. He has become my partner in doing music so being nominated with him twice is a sign that the works we put out are visible. “The awards are going to be interesting as the nominations are tight. We’re on the same zone with the likes of Kelly Khumalo and Dr Hlengiwe Mhlaba, a confirmation that the awards are dynamic and there’s no room for predictions.” Also nominated from Zimbabwe is Ndimi hit-maker, Janet Manyowa in the Best of Africa Gospel category for her Ndimi hit. Commenting on this honour, Manyowa who has been consistently putting a lot of work into her craft, said she was amazed by the nomination. “I’m totally amazed. Mwari anoshamisa!,” simply commented Manyowa. Manyowa is up against Nigerian David Dayo’s Do you know my God, Swaziland’s Thabile Myeni’s Sizobizwa Masinyane and Heal our land by Heal Africa. With events and small gatherings being allowed in South Africa as they are on lockdown stage one, Crown Gospel Awards founder Zanele Mbokazi-Nkambule revealed that the awards will be a hybrid event as some of the elements will be pre-recorded. <img class="wp-image-513358 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Canaan-Nyathi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Canaan-Nyathi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Canaan-Nyathi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Canaan Nyathi “We have decided to host this year’s edition of the awards on 29 November in Durban.
