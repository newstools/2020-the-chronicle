Gweru City Council public relations officer Ms Vimbai Chingwaramusee said Gweru fire brigade team attended the accident at about midnight on Friday last week. “Our fire brigade team rescued passengers and both drivers following a side swipe involving a haulage truck and a commuter omnibus near Regina Mundi High School around midnight. Two people who are said to be Zinara employees died on the spot,” she said. The employees had knocked off from work and were being ferried home aboard a commuter omnibus.
