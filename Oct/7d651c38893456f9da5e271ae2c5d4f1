AMAKHOSI are hoping for an improved performance to secure a second successive victory in the National Premier League against Harare Kings at Kwekwe Sports Club today. Amakhosi, formerly known as Emakhandeni Cricket Club, edged Queens Sports Club in the first match played on Sunday in a low scoring, but pulsating match. Chevrons limited overs skipper Chamunorwa Chibhabha top scored for Queens with 24 runs off 32 deliveries as they were dismissed for 97 in 26 overs. Spinner Ainsley Ndlovu and pace bowler Ernest Masuku were brilliant with ball, picking up four wickets apiece. Allen Chigoma was the highest run contributor for Amakhosi with 20, batting at number three. Thabo Mboyi guided his team over the line and finished unbeaten on 15 off 33 deliveries. Amakhosi captain Ndlovu said: “I’m happy we bowled well on Sunday, but we didn’t do well with our batting. “In a tourney like this you don’t want to dwell a lot on the negatives. “The good thing is that despite poor batting, at the end we won. Right now it’s evident that the guys are willing to do anything to win and that’s the attitude you need.”
