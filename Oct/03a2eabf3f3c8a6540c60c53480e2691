The Chronicle Tanzanian Premier League giants Young Africans SC have sacked their coach Zlatan Krmpotic after less than two months in charge. Krmpotic, a former Polokwane City coach, joined Yanga at the end of August this year replacing another Rise and Shine coach Luc Eymael, after their initial target Cedric Kaze turned them down. Among other clubs the 62-year-old Serbian has coached in Africa are TP Mazembe (DR Congo), Zesco United (Zambia) and APR of Rwanda. According to a source in Tanzania, Krmpotic was sacked for no reason. “The reason he was fired is good results you know,” the source tells KickOff.com. “People from the club don’t have patience you know. Five games in the league with four wins and one draw and just like that they wanted to change him. And what is surprising about the whole thing is that the club is among those on top of the table.” The source also mentions that Krmpotic will not be short of offers as he has already attracted interest from Tunisia. -—AP
