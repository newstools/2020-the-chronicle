The Chronicle Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar has been pictured promoting the 2020/21 Mamelodi Sundowns kit with Puma. The Brazil forward recently signed a lucrative deal with the German sportswear giant after terminating his long-term contract with Nike, which he served as a brand ambassador for from the age of 13. And as the new face of Puma, “the king” of the brand promoted the latest Sundowns kit offering on social media as the domestic treble winners gain global attention for their exploits. Having lost Pitso Mosimane to Al Ahly last week, Sundowns have made the bold decision to hire his former assistants Rhulani Mokwena and Manqoba Mngqithi as joint head coaches. Their decision has been well received for the continuity and placing faith in local talent and they will no doubt be looking to maintaining their upward trajectory of status that’s been showcased by none other than the Neymar. – Kick off.com
