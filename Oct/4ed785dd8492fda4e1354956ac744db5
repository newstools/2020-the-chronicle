A MAN from Esigodini has been arrested after he allegedly robbed his 54-year-old neighbour of R100 after threatening to stab her with a knife before raping her. Michael Ndlovu (23) from Ntabenende area in Esigodini was not asked to plead when he appeared before Gwanda magistrate, Ms Lerato Nyathi facing rape and robbery charges. He was remanded in custody to October 30. Prosecuting, Ms Ethel Mahachi said Ndlovu attacked the woman on August 6 at around 8PM near Ntabenende Business Centre while she was on her way home. “The complainant met Ndlovu at Ntabenende Business Centre where she had gone to buy a few groceries and they exchanged greetings and she left the accused person at the business centre. Ndlovu followed her as she left the business centre and when she was a few metres away, he grabbed her from behind, held a knife to her throat and ordered her to give him all the money she had. She tried to scream but Ndlovu covered her mouth with a cloth. “She gave him R100 and stated that it was all she had left but the accused person kept demanding more saying the money she had given him was too little. The accused person while still holding the knife ordered the complainant to remove her clothes and lie on the ground. She complied and he went on to rape her. While he was in the act, the accused person heard voices of people that were approaching the scene and he fled with the money,’’ she said. Miss Mahachi said the complainant alerted the people who were passing by and they tried to pursue Ndlovu but could not catch up with him. The matter was reported to the police who conducted investigations leading to Ndlovu’s arrest. — @DubeMatutu
