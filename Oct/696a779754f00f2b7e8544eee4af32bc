SOUTH Africa-based Bulawayo model Lindy Nyathi walked away victorious at the recently held Miss Witbank pageant after she was crowned Queen of Emalahleni and Best in Interview Miss Witbank model. The Miss Witbank pageant was held at Middleburg in Mpumalanga province where six finalists battled out for the crown. Speaking from Witbank, Lindy, said she was ecstatic that as an up-and-coming model she was able to prove her worth as this was her first professional modelling pageant. She said the lockdown worked in her favour as she used the period to work on her body and prepare for the ramp. “During the lockdown, I used to do my home workouts. I also used to watch former Miss South Africa, Zozibini Tunzi looking at how she carried herself and answered questions at pageants. This also inspired me to watch a lot of pageants. “Afterwards, I felt I was ready to contest and I decided to try out the Miss Witbank contest,” Lindy said.
Bred in Mahatshula, the 29-year-old mother of a three-year-old daughter Michaela R Tapfuma, is definitely not a beauty without brains. “I’m a Nust graduate who holds a degree in Journalism and Media Studies. In 2012, I was named Northlea Best ‘A’ Level results winner and when I came to South Africa, I lectured at Nkangala Training Centre in Witbank where I taught Communication N4. Presently, I own a company, Linchaela Media which focuses on web design and photography,” she said. Lindy said her next stop is to make an appearance at a continental pageant, possibly Miss Africa. –@mthabisi_mthire.
