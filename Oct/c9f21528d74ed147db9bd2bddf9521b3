POLICE in Beitbridge have arrested five men suspected to have been part of a gang of armed robbers that was terrorising Beitbridge residents together with the notorious John Sithole alias Kedha who was killed in a shootout with the police last Thursday. Kedha held 10 people hostage at his rented house in Dulivhadzimu house in a 14-hour standoff. Among the captives were fellow tenants, his wife and her 10-year-old sister whom he later released at the intervention of the Police Special Tactics Team (PSTT). Police sources yesterday said the gang, along with three others who are still at large, are accused of committing 35 robberies and one murder case in Beitbridge district since the beginning of the year. On the other hand, Kedha was facing two separate charges of raping a woman and her daughter before locking them in their house which he set on fire. Fortunately, the two women were saved by fellow villagers who put out the fire. <img class="wp-image-481645 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Assistant-Commissioner-Paul-Nyathi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Assistant-Commissioner-Paul-Nyathi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Assistant-Commissioner-Paul-Nyathi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi National police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the five were arrested on Tuesday evening in Beitbridge following intensive investigations. “Following the death of Sithole, we got information on the whereabouts of five of his accomplices whom we tracked to Dulivhadzimu suburb,” he said. “Those arrested are Blessing Itai Chiri (38), Dereck Ndou (34), Brian Mukosi (30), Mapfumo Makhado (31), and Taurai Coaster Dube (42) all of Dulivhadzimu in Beitbridge.” Asst Comm Nyathi said they arrested Chiri first and he cracked under interrogation leading detectives to the other four.
