AUTHORITIES in Kwekwe have activated the District Civil Protection Unit (CPU) to prepare for any disasters associated with the rain season. The district is prone to disasters such as flooding and hailstorms among others. Officially activating the CPU in the mining town on Thursday, Kwekwe District Development Co-ordinator who also chairs the committee, Mr Fortune Mpungu said there was need for the district to be proactive. The district CPU unit is made up of Government departments, the district’s three local authorities — Kwekwe City Council, Redcliff Municipality and Zibagwe Rural, non-governmental organisations, church organisations and the media among others. Mr Mpungu urged the three local authorities to quickly attend to storm water drains ahead of the rain season. “We saw it fit that we activate the district CPU in line with the national contingency plan. We are fast approaching the rain season where experts are predicting normal to above normal rains. As we are aware, rains are associated with disasters and we are anticipating disasters. Although it’s not our wish, we have to be ready of any eventuality,” said Mr Mpungu. He reminded the organisations about their critical roles in the committee. “As we are here to activate our CPU, every department should remember their role in the protection of our people. There is no department more important than the other. We all play important roles and we should work as one team in case of a disaster,” he said. Presenting his report, District Social Welfare Officer, Mr Edson Mudumo said about 7 000 people are receiving food aid in Zhombe while about 13 000 are receiving food aid in Kwekwe urban. “In Zhombe we are hundred percent while in Kwekwe urban we are about 44 percent. We will however, continue distributing as the food continue arriving at GMB,” said Mr Mudumo. Silobela which also falls under Kwekwe district is also benefiting from the programme.
