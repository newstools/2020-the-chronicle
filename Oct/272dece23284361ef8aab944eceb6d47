REBRANDED versatile musician Lp Tate previously known as Leprechaun, has collaborated with Nox on the single titled Sex Mummy. The single is set to be released on various digital platforms over the weekend and was recorded at Ice and Roses Studios in Midrand by Nox’s talented brother Tyfah Guni. The track also features Beitbridge’s up and coming musician Mark Geezo. Lp Tate said the song is meant to reclaim his mark in the music industry given that Nox recently worked with the man of the moment Master KG on the trending hit My Melody. “For my comeback I thought I should give people something that they are familiar with regardless of gender. “The song talks about a beautiful irresistible lady who is out there to be known and valued,” he said. Lp Tate started singing at Kuwadzana 1 Primary School while he was in Grade Six where he used to dance and sing South African hit songs. He says he was inspired by his late mother from Ntepe in Gwanda and his father who is a Pedi of Choeni Polokwane in South Africa. “When Jonathan Moyo was Minister of Information and Publicity during the days of 75 percent local content, I then started doing Urban Grooves songs like most of my Harare peers. I recorded my first song professionally at Chigutiro in 2006 and then came one of my all-time hit song titled Ndokukorobhera. “I have worked with the likes of DJ Mbale, Shinsoman, Trevor Dongo, Fadzi, Joshie cousin to Ngoni Kambarami, l Percy, Cal_Vin and many other acts,” he said. In South Africa he has worked with GT Beats, producer to Buffalo Soldier. “Basically I have been around for a while. I had taken a break due to other personal life issues. I lost my mother in June 2017 at a time when I was about to do big things. This kind of drained my energy and as a result I stopped recording,” said Lp Tate. – @mthabisi_mthire.
