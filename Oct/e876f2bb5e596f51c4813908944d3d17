TREASURY is expected to allocate more funding in next year’s budget for the rehabilitation of small thermal power stations as the country looks to increase power output. Energy and Power Development Minister, Zhemu Soda, said this in an interview as he acknowledged that the Harare and Bulawayo power stations were down while Munyathi was contributing only 16 megawatts to the national grid. He said the Government was geared to making sure the power stations are resuscitated. The plan includes rehabilitating and extending the life of the smaller thermal plants. “You might have heard that the equipment is giving in time and again, faults are reported time and again suggesting that there is urgent need to extend the life of those thermal power stations by replacing obsolete equipment,” said Minister Soda. He said plans were underway to inject more funds into the rehabilitation of the Bulawayo and Harare plants in next year’s budget. Although Minster Soda could not give an estimated figure in terms of rehabilitation costs, much funding could be required for the refurbishment of the power stations that have since outlived their lifespan. Zimbabwe requires about 1 800MW at peak periods but can only generate around 1 000MW produced mainly by Kariba Hydro Power Station and Hwange Thermal Power Station. The country is augmenting its internal generation with imports which is draining the much needed foreign currency. Hwange Thermal Power Station has rated capacity of 920MW but can only average 450MW at best due to lack of spare parts and frequent breakdowns as a result of the plant’s advanced age. The power plant, which now requires constant reinvigoration through refurbishments, has exceeded its design lifespan of 25 years.
