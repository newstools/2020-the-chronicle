BOSSO benefactors from across the globe have come to the aid of the Highlanders Royals through donations that were received by the club yesterday. While their male counterparts have been getting donations from companies, organisations and individuals, nothing was coming to the ladies’ side. Just like men sides, the Royals have also been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and the donations have certainly come as a timely boost. The Royals received food hampers from a group of well wishers in the diaspora as well as a playing kit from Hope Through Sports (HoTS), an organisation founded by Talent Ncube and Kevin Ngwenya. Each of the 25 food hampers was made up of 10kg mealie-meal, two litres cooking oil, 2kg sugar, sanitary wear, soap, 2kg rice, toothpaste, lotion and chunks. “We appreciate the challenges being faced by the Highlanders Royals FC in these difficult times. We hope this small gesture will ease some of the day-to-day challenges faced by our players,” read a joint statement from the Diasporans. Royals co-ordinator, Sibekiwe Ndlovu, who sourced the donations said he was pleased that well wishers had come forward to assist the side. “It’s the first time to get such a donation and we hope more people will come forward to assist the girls because they really need everyone’s support. Royals coach Vusumuzi Moyo said the donations were a morale booster for the girls. “I’m very happy with this gesture, this is what motivates the players to keep playing. This will also motivate others to join the team. “We are happy that we now have a new kit but the major challenge we have is lack of equipment,” said Moyo.
