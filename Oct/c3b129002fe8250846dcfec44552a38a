The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Warriors are set to leave this morning by road for an international friendly match against Malawi at Kamuzu Stadium on Sunday. Zifa communications and competitions manager, Xolisani Gwesela, who is also the acting team manager, said they expected to be in Blantyre just before 10pm on Friday. The travelling party includes all the players called up by coach Zdravko Logarusic, except the duo of Alec Mudimu who plays for Sherrif Tiraspol in Moldova, and Khama Billiat of Kaizer Chiefs. The duo will fly straight to Malawi, according to Gwesela.
