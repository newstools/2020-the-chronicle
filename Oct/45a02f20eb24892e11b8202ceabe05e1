Local artistes who were also friends to the late Bulawayo Hip Hop kingpin Mgcini “Cal Vin” Nhliziyo have found ways to come to terms with his death. Cal Vin died on Sunday at the age of 35 following a hit and run accident.

We met at Amakhosi Theatre at the Bigger Than Hip Hop events which were powered by POY and other guys. “We were both regular performers at these events so our friendship started there. We later on worked together on a number of projects, I even choreographed some of his perfomances,” said Mzoe 7. He is stil shocked with Cal vin’s death. Bidding farewell to his friend, Mzoe 7 said: “May God keep him at a safer place till we meet again.” Cal Vin always had a soft spot for young talent and this can be proven by a youthful army he recruited at his Kontrol Tribe Studio including Kwaito Boys Mawiza, Mzistoz Mfanafuthi, Frost and Tebza. On behalf of the Kontrol Tribe recruits, Tebza said: “We have lost a mentor and a brother, someone we always looked up to. Cal Vin was open and a straight talker who never compromised when it comes to music. “We are very lucky to have been part of his life as we learnt a lot from him. I learnt how to create beats and master vocals. “We promise to keep his legacy alive. May his resilient spirit rest in peace,” said the 2000’s president. Zimboy Jackson who is part of the Zim Hip Hop Awards organising committee and the founder of Changamire Hip Hop Festivals and Awards said: “I met Cal Vin in 2016 when I had booked him for a show in Gweru for the Changamire Hip Hop Festival. By then I was young with less money to feed big artistes like him. “However, when I told him my story that I couldn’t afford to pay him and suggested that we share gatetakings, he agreed. That’s when I realised that he was a humble person who worked with what was on the ground. He always stayed real to being Cal Vin,” said Zimboy. <img class="wp-image-516915 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Cal-and-locs.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Cal-and-locs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Cal-and-locs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimboy and Cal Vin with a fan Fashionista and model, Ben Chest said he will remember Cal Vin for his electric performances. “I will remember a lot of things about Mgcini. His smile, charm and the walk. He was a very confident young man who would rock up at a place without an invitation and when he arrived, the mood would just change. “Most of all, I will miss his perfomances. He always slit stages. When he performed, you would look forward to something dynamic. I know he used to say Banjalo abantu (people are like that), but laye ube njalo umfani (He was good like that),” said Ben Chest. <img class="wp-image-516916 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Cal-and-ben-chest.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Cal-and-ben-chest.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Cal-and-ben-chest-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Nospa, Ben Chest and Cal Vin Cal Vin’s longtime frenemy, Asaph said by the time of his death, the two were cool with each other. “Cal Vin and I had a lot going on in the music business, but personally, we were good friends. The vibe was always correct. He is one guy I worked a lot with in my career, especially on my Kingsvilla albums. I shall forever miss the challenge he brought to the game,” said Asaph. Songstress Qeqeshiwe Mntambo said she will forever miss Cal Vin because he never faked a smile and was always true to himself. Meanwhile, all is set for the Kasi to Kasi roadshow that is taking place in Bulawayo today from midday in honour of Cal Vin.
