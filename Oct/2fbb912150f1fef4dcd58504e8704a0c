First Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa, through her charity organisation Angel of Hope Foundation, has handed over reusable pads to girls in Matabeleland South Province in a bid to address challenges faced by the rural girl child in accessing sanitary wear. The Matabeleland South Minister for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Cde Abednico Ncube, handed over the donation to the District Development Coordinators of all the seven districts of the province on behalf of the First Lady on Tuesday. Speaking during the handover ceremony Cde Ncube thanked the First Lady for her kind gesture and urged the DDC’s to ensure that the sanitary pads reach the intended beneficiaries. In an interview, Mangwe District Development Coordinator, Ms Rorisang Makhurane said the sanitary pads will go a long way in addressing challenges that are being faced by the girl child in accessing sanitary wear. “We would like to thank the First Lady for remembering us as Matabeleland South Province and in particular our girl child. Sanitary pads have become so costly that most of our young girls and even young women can’t afford to buy them. As a province we would even like to copy this concept of reusable sanitary pads and even produce more at local level and distribute them to the communities. “The pandemic has affected supply of commodities for communities such as sanitary pads as our district is close to the Botswana border and people have been getting their supplies from the neighbouring country. The reusable pads are a good concept as they are washable and durable,” she said. — @DubeMatutu
