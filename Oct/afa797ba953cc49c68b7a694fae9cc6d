THE world over military badges and medals are accorded to war veterans and soldiers in recognition of their participation in life defining battles. Military badges and medals as such are cherished as they “immortalise” soldiers for the battles they fought. Zimbabwe’s ex-freedom fighters have therefore, been yearning for these military badges and medals for years, arguing that they had nothing to show for their sacrifices in the protracted war that brought about Zimbabwe’s independence. To some only oral accounts could attest to their involvement in the liberation war but as the memory fades, their contribution risked being forgotten. It is against this background that the former freedom fighters have been lobbying Government to accord them badges and medals in honour of their role in the armed struggle. President Mnangagwa’s Government has listened and put smiles on the faces of 80 former freedom fighters in Bulawayo as it awarded them Independence Medals, in recognition of their role in liberating Zimbabwe. The 80 were just symbolic of the process that Government is set to undertake across the country in recognition of the role played by the freedom fighters. The former freedom fighters were supposed to receive their medals on April 18, this year but Uhuru commemorations had to be suspended due to the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. The war veterans who have been accorded such medals in the past were only those who joined the Defence Forces. <img class="alignnone wp-image-514515 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/inde-medal.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/inde-medal.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/inde-medal-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube led the process of awarding the former freedom fighters the badges and medals at Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWA) Bulawayo provincial headquarters in Entumbane suburb. Cde Jeffrey Ndlovu (72) from Sunninghill suburb in Bulawayo, is among the 80 who received the Independence Medal yesterday. Cde Ndlovu lost both his eyes in October, 1979 when one of his comrades failed to defuse a landmine in the Chirundu area where he was deployed to assist fellow freedom fighters. “My life changed that day when a landmine that was set by our enemies exploded affecting both my eyes. So October has always been a very emotional month for me because that is the month when my life changed. Actually, I had to learn a new life just like a new-born child because of my disability,” said Cde Ndlovu. He said he was elated to receive the Independence Medal in recognition of his contribution to the liberation of his country. “My family will continue to be reminded of my contribution to the armed struggle by this medal even after my death,” said Cde Ndlovu. He commended the Government for taking the initiative to confer freedom fighters with the medals. Another former freedom fighter Cde Jabulani Zondo (66) from Nketa 6 suburb, said, he was lucky to have escaped the explosion that injured Cde Ndlovu. He said he had always looked forward to be honoured with a military medal to confirm his participation in the liberation war. “This is an important symbol confirming my participation in the liberation war leading to our independence. Even after my death, my children, my grandchildren and other relatives will proudly hold this medal as proof of my bravery for fighting for the liberation of this country. Although the medal has been long overdue, we welcome it. It will still serve its purpose,” he said. Another former freedom fighter Cde Abigail Nyamunda said having joined the liberation struggle at the age of 14 in 1976, she is proud to be accorded the Independence Medal. “I lost out on pursuing education when I joined the liberation struggle. To be awarded this medal is an honour for me and my family. This legacy will live forever even after my death,” said Cde Nyamunda. ZNLWA Bulawayo provincial chairperson Cde Cephas Ncube said the badges and medals were supposed to be presented during Independence Day celebrations which this year were supposed to be hosted by Bulawayo. “These badges and medals are supposed to be given to all freedom fighters. They are supposed to receive the Independence Medal and the Liberation Medal and we are happy that in just a short space of time the Second Republic has positively responded to our request for medals,” said Cde Ncube. Minister Ncube said Government is targeting former freedom fighters who did not join the defence forces. “These medals are given to those who participated in the armed liberation struggle. It’s recognition of their outstanding work. Some people might say it has taken too long to honour us but even in families there are things that can be overlooked but what is important is rectifying the mistake,” said Minister Ncube. — @nqotshili
