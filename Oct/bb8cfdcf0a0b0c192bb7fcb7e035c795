Harvest House lead singer, Admire T Saunyama has released a single Yinqaba as he announces his solo career. Admire led the Harvest Music Super Choir in a song titled Yahweh, from their Genesis album recorded and released last year. The song plays on ZBCtv and 1Gospel. Saunyama said the latest song was inspired by a worship session before lockdown. “My first single is entitled Yinqaba, inspired by a worship called public domain mostly sung at church called Uphakeme. I sang Uphakeme during worship time at Harvest House Church the last Sunday before the Covid-19-induced lockdown,”he said. Saunyama said during the lockdown he decided to record the song which he said was a way of his ministering through music. He said Yinqaba simply means He is a strong tower and encourages people to run to Him when things are tough. “The song encourages individuals to run to our Lord Jesus Christ in times of trouble. We are living in trying times but let’s always reflect on our Lord Jesus Christ and turn to Him for answers. In the song I encourage people not to commit suicide and not to dump babies,” said Admire. The former St Columbu’s High School pupil said he believes in the Bible verse of Proverbs 18:12 which says “A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.” “A gift must create room for me, the Bible says that your gift shall become your office. Ministering through music should be my line of work the same way Messi earns his income through football,” he said. Admire was part of the group Anointed Voices which once shared the stage with Takesure Zamar Ncube. — Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi.
