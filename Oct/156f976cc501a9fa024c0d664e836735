The Chronicle JOHANNESBURG – The bail application for self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri, his wife, Mary, and their co-accused has been postponed to Friday by the Pretoria Magistrates Court. The Bushiris and their three co-accused were arrested last week and face charges, including fraud and money laundering involving R102 million. The Bushiris and their co-accused will spend another four nights in the Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Centre in Pretoria. This after their case was rolled over to allow accused number one to explain to the court why he should be granted bail. Lawyer for accused number two earlier said that the State had no case against his client, saying that it would be in the interests of justice to release her since she had a child who she was breastfeeding. Earlier yesterday, Advocate Anneline van den Heever tried to persuade the magistrate to postpone the matter until today but the magistrate raised a number of concerns, saying that the court roll was full and she could only hear the matter on Friday. “As with today, we are more than willing to come and sit and wait our turn. I would suggest, your worship, that it would be in the interest of justice with regard to the facts that the matter be rolled over until tomorrow.” She also said that she was concerned about a large group of people outside the court building where social distancing was not being adhered to.-EyeWitnessNews.
