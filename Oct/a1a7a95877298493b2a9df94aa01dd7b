The Chronicle SUPERSPORT has acquired exclusive rights to broadcast the Ethiopian Premier League, the MultiChoice Group announced yesterday. As revealed by KickOff.com last month, the MultiChoice Group has continued to invest, with its subsidiary SuperSport in the development of football on the African continent, adding the Ethiopian topflight to its growing portfolio. With the Zambian Premier League and the DStv Premiership already secured on long-term television rights contracts, the South African broadcaster managed to outbid French cooperation Canal+ for the fast-growing league. “Through SuperSport, we are the leading broadcaster of sport in Africa, with our programming being viewed by millions of fans continent-wide,” MultiChoice Group CEO Calvo Mawela said in a statement. “Sport is an integral part of our content offering and supporting the development of sport content makes sense for our business. This partnership will give the Ethiopian Premier League greater visibility, attracting fans from across the continent.” — KickOff
