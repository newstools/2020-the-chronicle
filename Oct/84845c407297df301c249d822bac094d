THE Bulawayo Table Tennis Association (BTTA) says it has been difficult to organise amateur tournaments as a result of a freeze in schools’ sports. Table tennis is among sports that have been given the go-ahead to resume activities under strict health and safety measures in accordance with the country’s Covid-19 lockdown protocols. Two months ago, the BTTA organised a virtual Level 1 coaching course that was meant to equip up-and-coming coaches with the requisite skills to train budding players. Immediately after the course the association had planned to have an amateur tournament but the plans were derailed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. BTTA chairperson Bibiana Ncube said: “Our main target was schools, the majority of participants of the coaching course were teachers. “Since schools have since been banned from playing any sport it has been difficult for us to go ahead with the tournament.” BTTA is in the process of reviving table tennis by urging schools and tertiary institutions to introduce it in their extracurricular activities to help develop the game in Zimbabwe. Schools’ sport plays a huge role as a talent nurturing ground and feeder system for the country’s professional sporting disciplines. National schools’ competitions have over the years been a good ground for talent identification and some athletes have ended up in professional ranks locally and abroad. However, most budding sportspersons’ dreams have been shuttered by the pandemic this year, as schools have been closed since March with phased opening of schools beginning with examination classes last month. Grassroot sport development, particularly schools’ sport, continues to suffer due to the Covid-19 pandemic as schools have opened without the extra circular activities on their calendar. — @innocentskizoe
