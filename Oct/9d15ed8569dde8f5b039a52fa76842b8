BEITBRIDGE house muso Bhadilah says he is unshaken by false reports circulating on social media that he tested positive for Covid-19.
Over the weekend, social media was awash with reports that the award-winning artiste had tested positive to coronavirus. In an interview, Bhadilah said he is safe and sound and urged fans not to believe everything they hear. “This (circulation of false rumours) has shown that I’m in the right direction as people wouldn’t have written such a thing about me if I wasn’t a threat to them. But because I have a good management team, they’ve made sure my name isn’t tarnished by these cyber bullies,” the muso said. “We’re yet to engage law enforcement agencies in a bid to investigate on the person who wrote the fake article. All I can tell lovers of my music is that their artiste is very fit and fine. Actually, this week I’ll be giving them a new music video for Nthengeleni,” said Bhadilah. He went on to pass his condolences to Cal Vin’s family and arts fraternity saying the nation had been robbed of a great musician. He said they once worked together in 2017. “Cal Vin was a dear brother and very caring,” said Bhadilah of Cal Vin who was fatally hit by a car in Bulawayo on Sunday. “He was naturally a leader who was good in mentoring up-and-coming talent. I first met him during the Bigger than Hip Hop sessions at Cape to Cairo where he congratulated me after my performance and told me to polish up on a few aspects. “Sometime in 2017, I called him for a collaboration (actually a remake) for my track Monday Yangbhora and he never hesitated to put a verse on it. He laid a verse which narrated how we loved weekends and having fun. I was really hurt to receive the news of his death.” – @mthabisi_mthire.
