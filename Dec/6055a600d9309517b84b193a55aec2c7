The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zifa annual general meeting, which had been scheduled for Saturday, has been postponed to the end of the year due late receipt of the national association’s audited financial statements. There was also a statutory requirement for the financial statements to be distributed at least 15 days before the AGM. “The Zimbabwe Football Association hereby informs you of the postponement of the Zifa annual general meeting previously set for the 19th of December 2020,” wrote the Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela announcing postponement of the gathering to the association’s 25 affiliates. Gwesela said the agenda of the meeting, to be held at a yet to be identified place in Harare, remains unchanged. “Please kindly note that the postponement has been necessitated by the late receipt of the 2019 Zifa audited financial statements resulting from circumstances beyond the auditors and Zifa’s control. Further, there is need to comply with our constitution, which requires that financial statements be circulated at least 15 days before the AGM, while also making sure that the AGM takes place in 2020. The executive committee has therefore seen it fit to reschedule the AGM to the 31st December 2020,” wrote Gwesela. The two-week postponement will see suspended Zifa vice-president and Bulawayo businessman Gift Banda’s return to football also being pushed back, as it has emerged that a number of councillors led by some Premier Soccer League governors had resolved to move a motion for charges against him to be dropped.
