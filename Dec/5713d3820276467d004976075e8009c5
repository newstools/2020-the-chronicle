ZIMBABWE Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo province acting chairman Joseph Nkomazana says clubs must prepare to return to the court after the festive season. Netball has been given the green light to resume activities and the Zina executive met in Harare on Sunday to deliberate on the best way forward under strict Covid-19 guidelines. Zina has appealed to all netball clubs, including social leagues, to register in a move they hope will help in implementing regulations and guidelines compliant with conditions set for resumption of the sport. “We are already engaging clubs to be ready to start training soon after the festive holidays. There will be a circular to clubs articulating the things to follow in line with the World Health Organisation and the Government through the Ministry of Health and Child Care, and the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation,” said Nkomazana. Zina had already put in place plans to introduce a Division Two league that will feature teams from around Bulawayo and were halted by the suspension of all sporting activities at the end of March following a Covid-19-induced lockdown. The Division Two league is aimed at accommodating and nurturing players that can’t make it into Division One and Super League teams. – @innocentskizoe
