The 2020 Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAA) turned out to be a Chuck Taylor All-Star affair as a number of artistes and event attendees rocked up wearing them. A few lucky artistes were sponsored by local businessman Leroy Waps and his associate Davison Feliate who gave away four pairs to the artistes to don at the awards’ red-carpet and on stage. <img class="alignnone wp-image-521114 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Artistes who benefited included Asambeni hit-maker Mzoe 7, comedian Ntando Van Moyo, Podcaster and filmmaker Nigel Ndlovu and Roil BAA 2020 Best Male Artiste Msiz’Kay. <img class="alignnone wp-image-521115 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Waps who is also part of Events Africa, an artistes’ management company revealed that the initiative was part of appreciating local artistes who are putting Bulawayo’s arts on the world map. “It’s a good thing to appreciate people while you still can by giving them a token of gratitude. I decided to give away the All Stars to these artistes because I know their craft and respect it. <img class="alignnone wp-image-521111 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Initially, I wanted to give Nigel Ndlovu but I saw it unfair to give only one person while there are many who also need to be appreciated. So, Davison came through and we partnered to give All Stars to four artistes of our preference,” said Waps. As the festive season is all about giving and sharing, Waps who runs an online shoes shop which supplies mainly in Zimbabwe and Botswana, said plans to give away other products to those in need are underway. <img class="alignnone wp-image-521110 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/baa1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The Covid-19 pandemic hit a lot of people hard and I’d like to advise those who can to lend a hand here and there to do so. For the festive season, I’m mapping ways of helping different societies through donating shoes. Who knows, maybe this gesture can change someone’s life.”
