The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter The vibe was definitely correct at the Zim Hip Hop awards last night as Bulawayo’s finest rapper, Asaph reigned supreme at the awards where he scooped four gongs. Fast-rising Holy Ten who is behind the Ndaremerwa hit and R Peels also had a good night as they scooped three and two awards each respectively. The Ginde track in which Asaph featured on earlier this year put him on the map as it earned him and Crooger nods for Best Collaboration and Best Video. Asaph was also awarded for having the Best hip hop verse and Hip Hop personality. Ndaremerwa by Holy Ten was another fan favourite as it got Holy Ten the Song of the year, People’s Choice and Best Newcomer awards. Eke hit-maker, R Peels who recently declared that he was out to take over the hip hop scene seems to be on the right track as he is officially the Zim hip hop best male artiste.
