THE Warriors’ preparation for next month’s Chan championship in Cameroon has been thrown into turmoil after nine players tested positive for Covid-19 after returning to camp on Monday. Training has been halted immediately and those that tested positive are in quarantine. In a statement yesterday afternoon, Zifa said tests were done on Monday in adherence to Covid-19 medical protocols and there were nine positive tests. “The Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) would like to inform the football fraternity and the nation at large that nine players, who are part of the African Nations Championship (Chan) provisional squad have tested positive for Covid-19. In adherence to our Covid-19 medical protocols, all players and members of the technical team were tested on Monday upon their return from the festive break and nine tested positive,” said the national association in a statement. All the affected players, Zifa said, have been notified and quarantined in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) dictates. “The players have also been advised to inform their families and contacts. The Zimbabwe Football Association has also informed the Confederation of African Football (Caf), Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) and the (Harare) City Health Department for further guidance,” the statement further read. Zifa said it had temporarily suspended all training sessions for the Chan team pending consultations with other stakeholders but the team will remain in camp until further notice.
