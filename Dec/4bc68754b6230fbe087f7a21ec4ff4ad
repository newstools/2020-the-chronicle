Unfortunately, the conventional close contact event will not be happening at the traditional Stanley Hall and Square but will run virtually this year from the 17th to the 21st of December 2020,” said Lady Tshawe. “We are not limiting ourselves to just the physical audience but we are opening up to virtual audience which has become the ‘new normal’. Lady Tshawe said although Covid-19 has changed a lot the lives of artistes, the festival must go ahead. “We are well aware as festival organisers that Covid-19 has changed a lot of what used to be done but we are known to be a festival that defies all odds and seeks to be trendsetters and this year is no different. We will run our festival on our main social media pages,” said Lady Tshawe. Ibumba Festival has been run in Bulawayo by Siyaya Arts since 1996 and has been held in Makokoba ever since. Normally the festival will have an array of theatre, music, dance, film, workshops and literary arts performances. The late great Dr Oliver Mtukudzi once performed at the festival. — Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi.
