DECEMBER 10 is a very important day for comedian and entrepreneur Carl Joshua Ncube as this was the day in 2010 that he set out a 10-year plan for his life. On that day, he introduced people to Carl Joshua the comedian through packing the Harare International Conference Centre with his sold out show that he named, Carl Joshua Ncube’s Big Announcement. It was at that show that he went on a bended knee and proposed to his wife, Nelsy. She said “Yes.” <img class="wp-image-522159 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/carl2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/carl2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/carl2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Carl Joshua Ncube and wife Nelsy “This very day 10 years ago, wearing torn jeans that were sewn together, I had a sold-out show that put me in debt. I had no money to buy a ring, but just a promise and a prayer. I humbled myself on one knee and asked my girlfriend if she would agree for me to be with her forever. “I promised to love her realistically! We created our own happiness using our rules and we’re looking forward to many more to come,” said Carl in a Facebook post this past week. Looking at their relationship, all that Carl promised to do is exactly what he is doing and more as the two lovebirds who are inseparable are serving relationship goals. Nelsy has certainly been Carl’s pillar of strength as she has been supporting most of his crazy ideas. Over the 10 years, the comic has been a restaurateur, chef, advertising executive, creative director and designer, things he has done with ease. Promoting the country’s tourism has also been close to his heart. <img class="wp-image-522160 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/carl3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/carl3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/carl3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Carl Joshua Ncube and wife Nelsy Reflecting on his 10-year business plan, Carl said with its ambition, it seemed impossible at that time. “It included doing stuff like a TED Talk, travelling the world, being on CNN, BBC and Sky News. I wanted to meet Mugabe and make fun of him and have him laugh at himself. I wanted to be part of growing the African comedy scene and the Zimbabwean comedy scene. These were my notes 10 years ago. “It seemed so impossible, but I was going to give it a try starting that night,” said Carl. Since then, Carl has appeared on CNN where he was once labelled The New Face of Zimbabwean Comedy. He has also been on BBC and has given a TED talk (influential video from expert speakers). He unfortunately did not meet former President of Zimbabwe, the late Robert Mugabe, but he won awards nationally and made his mark in the continent as one of the best comedians from Zimbabwe. Carl said all this was possible because: “God has done an amazing thing in my life!” After years in Harare, Carl and his wife Nelsy relocated to Victoria Falls in 2017. Here, they lived in a tent as they said they were tired of paying rent before they made a bold move of renovating an old bus and converting it into a home. This is where they are currently residing. <img class="wp-image-522162 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/carl4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/carl4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/carl4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Carl Joshua Ncube Now Carl has embarked on what he has termed the Ekaya project aimed at promoting rural tourism. The comedian-cum businessman said he envisaged Ekaya as a think-tank empowering marginalised rural folks with innovative ideas that would benefit future generations to come. Under the model, families are to renovate their homes to the required standard and earn an extra buck by housing tourists. Ekaya will leverage on the AirBnB model. AirBnB (bread and breakfast) is an increasingly popular online marketplace connecting travellers with people who want rent out their homes. These are some of the things Carl has achieved over the past 10 years and he does not seem to be slowing down as he has also hinted that he is penning a book on relationships. — @bonganinkunzi
