ZIMBABWE Cricket (ZC) has pushed back the start of the Logan Cup by a week to allow for more time to finalise logistics for a bio-secure bubble for the country’s first-class competition. The four-day tournament had initially been scheduled to begin on Thursday, but it will now get underway on December 9, with Mountaineers facing Eagles and Tuskers taking on Rhinos in the opening games. Southern Rocks are back in the elite domestic competitions for the first time since the 2013/14 season and will be in action against Tuskers from December 15-18 after getting a bye in the first round. Rhinos and Eagles will tussle in the other match before the Christmas break. All matches will be played in Harare. In another first for local sport, ZC has set up a bio-secure bubble in Harare for the five first-class teams. A bio-secure bubble refers to an environment cut off from the outside world to minimise the risk of players and support staff contracting Covid-19 This will see up to 100 players and support staff being tested for Covid-19 before checking into strictly controlled accommodation facilities. The bubble will cover the teams’ accommodation, practice and match venues as well as transport facilities. All those in the bubble will not have access to families, visitors, friends or relatives for the duration of the tournament. Apart from strictly adhering to all Covid-19 protocols such as sanitisation and social distancing, all individuals within the bubble will be monitored daily for symptoms through temperature checks. “The health and well-being of players and staff remains the highest priority at ZC and the organisation will continue to adhere to Government health guidelines in order to curb the spread of the pandemic,” said ZC. Meanwhile, six club players and a coach that tested Covid-19 positive last month, have now returned following their recovery.
