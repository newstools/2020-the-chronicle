THE Zanu-PF District Coordinating Committee (DCC) elections were concluded smoothly in Matabeleland South Province despite a few logistical issues, a senior party official said yesterday. Addressing a Press conference at the party’s Matabeleland South provincial headquarters in Gwanda, Politburo member Dr Sithembiso Nyoni who is the leader of the Matabeleland South DCC election process said voting was held successfully in all the seven administrative districts of the province. “The voting process started on Friday with orientation and training for all the teams that were going to be involved. “On Saturday, however, the voting process started late due to logistical problems as the ballot boxes and papers arrived a bit late,” she said. “There was also a challenge of moving them to the points. “Voting continued on Sunday and we concluded the counting this morning. “Matabeleland South has seven administrative districts, which means elections for seven DCCs were conducted and they were successful as far as we could possibly manage it.” Dr Nyoni said although there were unforeseen challenges such as heavy rains, voting was smooth without no incidents of violence being recorded throughout. “Though the party had its own shortcomings along the process, everything was resolved amicably here in Matabeleland South and the results have been sent to the headquarters in Harare where they will be announced,” she said. Dr Nyoni said some wards did not vote as ballot papers arrived late because heavy rains made some roads impassable. In addition, a number of areas had no polling officers, lack of dissemination of information to voters while some members were not properly registered. She said party members in 127 out of 162 wards voted. — @DubeMatutu
