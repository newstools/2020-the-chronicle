By 11am we had a total of 47 travellers who passed through or both arrival and exit sides. “These are pedestrians and private motorists and expect the numbers to increase going forward,” he said. ” It is clear that people are still skeptical since we’ve just reopened. As immigration we held a meeting with our Botswana counterparts to harmonise our operations.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-520506 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Plumtree2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Plumtree2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Plumtree2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Munyaradzi said every traveller is required to go through the screening process at the health port in line with Covid 19 regulations. “We adhere to the Covid-19 19 protocols, which stipulate that every traveller should go through the port health officials before accessing the immigration hall. They’re also supposed to produce a Covid-19 certificate,” he said. Prior to the closure of the border, Mr Munyaradzi said they handled about 2 000 travellers daily with numbers increasing during peak periods. Travellers who spoke to Chronicle expressed concern over the US$60 required by laboratories for Covid-19 tests. Ms Memory Shumba of Rusape urged Government to intervene on the testing fees being charged by most laboratories, saying they were beyond the reach of ordinary people. “Our main worry is that the US$60 charged by laboratories is too much. Government should consider looking into this issue,” she said. She however, said the services offered by both Zimbabwean and Botswana immigration authorities were exceptionally good and commendable.
