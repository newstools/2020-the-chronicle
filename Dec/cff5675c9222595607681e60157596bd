The Chronicle Ovidy Karuru’s agent has spoken about the player’s perfect start with Black Leopards after the Zimbabwean international netted two goals against his former club Kaizer Chiefs on debut. Karuru came close to handing Leopards victory after he was handed a start in coach Dylan Kerr’s team in his first match on Wednesday. However, the Limpopo outfit was denied the three points after Amakhosi staged a late comeback to finish the match deadlocked at 2-2. Karuru (31) joined Lidoda Duvha last month, following last season’s stint with Stellenbosch FC. He has also previously played for AmaZulu since arriving in Mzansi in 2014 to join Chiefs. His agent Ayanda Sigwili said the attacker’s aim is to resurrect his career after some disappointments at his previous clubs. “I’m so happy for him; it’s a pity they didn’t get maximum points. I would also like to take this time to thank (Leopards chairman) Mr (David) Thidiela and everyone at Leopards for giving him an opportunity to remind people what he is capable of,” said Sigwili. “He deserves to play football and I know he can score goals if he is played in the right position. He is a hard worker and he respects his job. Things didn’t work out at his former club, but that’s football and you have to dust yourself and move on,” he said. – Soccer Laduma
