ECONET Victoria Falls Marathon race director John Addington has given a thumbs up to the 14th edition of the event held virtually at the weekend. This was the first time since 2006 that the marathon was held virtually as runners complied with social distancing measures in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. “We say thank you to our amazing naming rights sponsors, Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, who made this first-ever virtual race possible,” said Addington. Econet gave running tops to locally registered runners and presented smart watches, trainers, running pouches and water bottles to the first 1 000 locally registered Zimbabwean runners. Addington said they were still collating data from those who participated and uploaded their finishing time, and will be announcing the marathon winners and prizes in the coming weeks. “Participants should visit our website to both download their official finish certificates in the results section and to view their Virtual Goody Bag offering for various vouchers and discounts that they can redeem when they join us for the physical race on the 4th of July 2021,” he said. Econet Group chief executive officer Douglas Mboweni said the successful hosting of the Econet Victoria Falls Marathon underlined their commitment to wellness and a healthy lifestyle in all seasons of life. “We could have easily postponed the event to next year due to Covid-19, but life doesn’t stop because of pandemics and the need to life and maintain healthy lifestyles continues,” Mboweni said.
