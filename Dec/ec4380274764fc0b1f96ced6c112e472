THE Biya and Friends Academy has a new executive committee led by Arnold Sibanda, who took over from Sikelelo Ndiweni as chairman. Sibanda will be deputised by Mandla Moyo, with Sheunesu Manwa assuming the role of treasurer, which was previously held by George Sibanda, who is now the academy’s committee member. Taurai Severa joined the new committee as secretary-general replacing Rachel Ndlovu. Babingiton Chingoto, the academy’s ex-committee member, is now the new team manager. The five-year old Biya and Friends Academy has grown and is now a “theatre of dreams” for a number of kids that dream of playing professional football. On Christmas Eve the academy donated an assortment of groceries to Entembeni Old People’s Home and Thembiso Children’s Centre in Luveve suburb. “Every year we donate groceries to needy centres and I’m glad to say this year we did it again as we took groceries to Entembeni Old People’s Home and Thembiso Children’s Centre. “It’s part of our social responsibility programme,” said the academy’s Australia-based co-director Thulani Khumalo.
The other director is former Bosso and Warriors captain Thulani “Biya” Ncube, who is based in the United States of America. “Although we did not have any football action owing to Covid-19, we are still committed to rewarding our outstanding players on the field and those that would have excelled academically at school. For the best academic players, we offer mini-scholarships where we pay their school fees for a year,” he said.
