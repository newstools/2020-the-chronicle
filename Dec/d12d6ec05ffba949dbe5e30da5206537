National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ), organisers of the inaugural National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) Legends @40 awards are looking for creative and talented designers/artists who will come up with a design for the awards’ trophies. In a statement, NACZ said the winning trophy design will be manufactured and presented to the recipients of the awards next year. The winner of the trophy design is set to pocket $65 000 cash. “NACZ is calling on individual artists and/or design houses to enter this competition and produce a trophy that will be presented to Zimbabwean living legends. The first-place designer will receive a $65 000 cash prize and attendance to the Nama Legends@40 awards ceremony. They will also get recognition at the awards ceremony in front of the legends and a large virtual crowd,” NACZ said in their statement. Deadline for the submission of designs is December 21. The awards which seek to honour and recognise living legendary creatives who have raised the country’s flag high will run under the theme “Our Legacy, Our Pride”. They will be held on February 27 at a venue yet to be announced. NACZ director Nicholas Moyo said by hosting the Living Legends Awards, the desire is to reflect on the developments in the cultural and creative industries over the past 40 years and celebrate achievements by providing honorary awards to the people who were influential during that period in shaping various sub-sectors. “The awards are a special honour and recognition to legendary creatives who have raised the flag of the country over the stated period,” he said. “The Living Legends Awards are thus meant to inspire practitioners in the sector which is re-opening post-Covid-19 to take advantage of the new creative environment and get back to their creative spaces and produce artworks that will make them the future legends.”
