Rapper Indigo Saint says fellow MCs should concentrate on their lyrics than having a great melody as this was the most important component of hip-hop music, something that some in the rap game have forgotten. Speaking after winning The Best Alternative artiste gong at this year’s Zim Hip-Hop Awards, Indigo Saint said he focuses more on the lyrical content part of his music. “The hip-hop community believes it means more melody than hard written punchlines and bars. For me it’s about working parallel with the mainstream but not with. I’ve always had my own way of doing things and that’s what I want to define alternative as,” said Indigo Saint. <img class="alignnone wp-image-523069 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Indigo2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Indigo2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Indigo2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “On my music, definitely God. Through him I’ve met everyone I know and all my best songs are songs written in the presence of or through His grace.” This was his second Zim Hip-Hop Aaward after winning one in 2017. Indigo Saint has been at it for the past 10 years and his musical journey has taken him to Pretoria to study at the University of Pretoria and got influenced by the Pretoria Hip-Hop scene. Indigo Saint has constantly been part of cyphers that would in turn nurture and influence his hip-hop style. Indigo Saint, born Mzwakhiwe Ngwenya, dedicated his award to his team Cottage 47, who were also nominated at this year’s awards. “It’s always great to be recognised so to me, the awards mean the efforts my team (Cottage 47) and I have been making are finally being recognised. <img class="alignnone wp-image-523072 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Indigo3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Indigo3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Indigo3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “To be honest, I decided this year to make a song every week and from that we did 46. Every week was an opportunity for me to redefine myself and my brand. I’ve always said that before I’m a rapper I’m a musician first and my job is to create,” he said. Indigo Saint has been releasing projects and has 10 under his name with the most recent Portland 51 released this year. His repertoire includes the popular The Blunts EP which won him a Zim Hip -Hop award in 2017. The Blunt EP addresses issues of depression, mental health and suicidal thoughts among young people and losing one of his best friends to suicide inspired his project. — Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi
