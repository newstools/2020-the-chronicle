A food and wine festival where three top chefs, Joseph Baleni, David Mbongeni Masuku and Zinzile Masiye are expected to show people how to pair their meals with wine will be held this weekend to get people into the festive mood. The two-day event which will have live musical performances will be held from Saturday at popular eatery, Smokehouse Bar and Grill with Kumusha Wines set to take people through wine tasting. Kumusha Wines is the brainchild of Zimbabwean sommelier, Tinashe Nyamudoka who is based in South Africa.

It’s never been done before and this will be the very first food and wine festival in Bulawayo. <img class="wp-image-521769 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Joseph-Baleni.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Joseph-Baleni.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Joseph-Baleni-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joseph Baleni “We want to introduce something fun, different and classy that will attract people who love good wine and good food.
