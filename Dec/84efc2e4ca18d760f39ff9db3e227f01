ASPIRING Highlanders’ committee member Bheka Sibanda has warned that neglecting the club’s developmental sides will be detrimental to Bosso’s aspirations of regaining their giant status in domestic football. Sibanda is eyeing the role of committee member that will be vacated by Wisdom Mabhena, who has completed the maximum two-term limit stipulated by the club’s constitution. “A lot has been said about the club’s promising junior policy and it’s unfortunate that some members are of the view that developmental sides are straining the club’s coffers. I beg to differ with members of the Bosso family that believe we can do without junior sides and concentrate only on the senior team. Such a move will be very detrimental to the future of the club and we can take that route at our own risk,” said Sibanda. “Yes, the club has continuously gone on the market to buy players from other teams, but we need to produce our own stars as we did with the likes of Siza Khoza, Gift Lunga (junior) and most recently Prince Dube, among others.” Sibanda recently donated an assortment of groceries to the club’s technical staff members and paid all the junior coaches’ wages in July. Sibanda could square off with another passionate Bosso member Mgcini Mafu for the committee member role at Bosso’s elective annual general meeting set for early next year. Club chairman Kenneth Mhlophe and secretary-general Israel Moyo, who have both served one term each, will be available for re-election. Nominations are set for next month. Mhlophe is likely to be challenged by Bosso life member Anderson Ncube at the AGM after another touted challenger and former chairman Themba Ndlela ruled himself out, saying he believes in leadership renewal. Ndlela said he would only be available to advise whoever is elected. — @FungaiMuderere
