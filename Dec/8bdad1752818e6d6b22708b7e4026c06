THE Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura) music and arts hub in Bulawayo which held its groundbreaking ceremony last Tuesday is expected to be completed in three years. The building plan for the site is awaiting approval from the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) with part of the funds for the construction of the state-of-the-art cultural centre already available. <img class="alignnone wp-image-521096 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/zimura-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/zimura-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/zimura-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Located on a 5 000 square metre site at Emahlangeni, the music and arts hub is expected to accommodate among other things; an administration block that will house arts disciplines — music, theatre, dance, film and literary works; a multi-purpose sound proofed auditorium for performances and conferencing; and training and rehearsal rooms. A boarding facility to accommodate between 15 and 20 people for cultural exchange programmes (local and international initiatives), music and arts library; music and arts museum and a cafeteria with Wi-Fi will also be put up. If completed, this will be the first of its kind in the country. In a wide-ranging interview with Chronicle Showbiz, Zimura executive director Polisile Ncube-Chimhini said the Zimura team is working flat out to ensure the project materialises. “Construction in Bulawayo is expected to start as soon as our building plan is approved by the BCC. We’ve already engaged an architect who’s drawing the plan. Part of the funds are already available and we’ll look for partners as we go,” said Ncube-Chimhini.  She said the overall budget will be availed when the plan has been approved. “The music and arts hub should be complete in about three years and it’ll not be for Zimura members only, but all artistes. Artistes from all genres will be expected to pay subsidised rates to use the facility.” She said their organisation reached a decision to close some of their nationwide offices as a way of cutting costs and instead, investing in having their own permanent offices. “Zimura employees are 27 and they’re based in four cities — Mutare, Harare, Gweru and Bulawayo. We’ve had to scale down to cut rental costs as previously we had offices in Chinhoyi, Marondera and Masvingo. We’ve instead opted to get land so that we build permanent structures,” Ncube-Chimhini said. The Zimura board is chaired by Albert Nyathi who is deputised by Mechanic Manyeruke. Other members are Witness Zhangazha (legal advisor) and MP Dingumuzi Phuti, Nathaniel Ncube, Phillip Chifumbu, First Farai and Janet Manyowa. <img class="alignnone wp-image-521093 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/zimura-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/zimura-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/zimura-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony Zimura board chairperson Albert Nyathi said he was proud of the steps they have taken so far while veteran musician Jeys Marabini hailed the Zimura team for its efforts. “This is a great venture as it’s a project that if successful, even in 3030 when we’re all gone, it will be up and active. This shows that artistes are here to stay and it’s time for them to be appreciated,” Marabini said. He went on to encourage artistes to register with Zimura to ensure that their royalties are paid. Present at the groundbreaking ceremony were most of the Zimura board members and artistes LMG’s Happiness Sibanda, Sandra Ndebele, Nceku’s manager Wisdom Nyathi, poet Sithandazile Dube and Saimon Mambazo Phiri among many others. — @mthabisi_mthire.
