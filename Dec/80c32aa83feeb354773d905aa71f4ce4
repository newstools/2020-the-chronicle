Cyrus, 28, added: “And I really do and did love him very, very, very much and still do, always will.” She said there was “too much conflict” between the pair. “When I come home, I want to be anchored by someone. I don’t get off on drama or fighting.” After the break-up, Hemsworth, 30, wished the star “health and happiness” in a post on social media. A few weeks later, Cyrus posted a thread of tweets denying that she had cheated during their seven-month marriage, As well as her break-up, the singer, who released her latest album Plastic Hearts in November, also discussed her attempts to stay sober during the COVID-19 pandemic in her interview with Stern. She gave up alcohol following surgery on her vocal cords in 2019. “The hardest times have been in this pandemic,” she said. “I am always truthful. And a lot of people, their sobriety broke during this time. I was one of them. Luckily, I haven’t gone back to using any drugs, but I was drinking during the pandemic.” However, she said she was not calling it a “relapse,” saying drinking had not “been my demon”. “If anything, it just makes me not reach my full potential, which is unacceptable to me,” she said. – skynews
