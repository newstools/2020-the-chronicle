The hyenas attacked and killed Mr Tendai Maseka of Banure Village under Chief Chirumanzu while he was asleep in his bedroom hut at night. Following the attack, Zimparks rangers were deployed to the area to track and kill the hyenas which have become a menace in the area where they have also killed livestock.

Mr Farawo urged the Chirumanzu community to work together with the officials on the ground in tracking down the remaining hyenas.
