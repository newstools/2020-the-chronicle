A 10-YEAR-OLD boy from Ndlovu outside Victoria Falls drowned while swimming with two other juveniles in a stream. The incident happened on Friday and the boy was buried yesterday afternoon in Mpumelelo Village BH25, Ndlovu under Chief Mvuthu. <img class="alignnone wp-image-522607 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Vic-falls-boy2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Vic-falls-boy2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Vic-falls-boy2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The now deceased boy Pardon Nkosikhona Nyoni reportedly left his grandparents’ homestead where he stayed with his grandmother Mrs Gladys Maphosa and went to swim at a nearby Malayitha stream about 600 metres from the homestead. The boy was in the company of two juveniles younger than him who later rushed to inform elders after realising he was drowning. Family spokesperson Mr Morgen Gazza Dube who is the boy’s uncle said the family was heartbroken. “He left home in the company of two others to go and swim at the stream. It looks like he was the first to go into the deep pool while his friends waited for him to return and when they realised he was not returning, they rushed home to inform the elders,” said Mr Dube. According to villagers, Pardon is the second boy to drown in the stream after another drowned a few years ago. The stream is called Malayitha because some years back a man called Malayitha from the same community narrowly survived death after he was swept by the flooded stream but managed to escape with the help of other villagers. — @ncubeleon
