The Chronicle The late former President, Cde Robert Mugabe and Dr Joshua Nkomo as leaders of Zanu (PF) and PF-Zapu respectively are the architects of the Unity Accord which they signed on December 22, 1987 to end civil disturbances in parts of Matabeleland region and Midlands Province. Cde Mugabe passed away on September 6, 2019 while Dr Nkomo passed away on 1 July 1999.

He signed for Zanu-PF while Dr Joshua Nkomo signed for PF-Zapu. The united Zanu-PF has, since then dominated the local political scene, not only because of its close history with the masses dating back to the liberation war, but also its people-centred programmes.

The late Dr Joshua Nkomo was one of the founders of nationalism in Zimbabwe. He was involved in the earliest struggles against white misrule from the late 1940s. He played a prominent role in the 1948 general strike, which paralysed the whole country. After years of black opposition to white colonialism, the nationalists of the time decided to adopt a more confrontational stance, calling the general strike, which brought industry and commerce to a standstill. One of the prominent figures he worked with was the late Grey Mabhalane Bango. The 1948 strike was essentially a labour protest, in which black workers sought to protest against poor salaries and appalling working conditions they were forced to work under. But there was no way one could really divorce such a national protest from the politics of the time, for it was because of the colonial politics of the day that blacks were paid poor salaries while whites, some doing exactly the same jobs like blacks earned higher wages. It was also because of the oppressive and racist politics of the day that blacks were not allowed to advance their education. Blacks were supposed to stop going to school once they attained a Standard Six certificate. Only a lucky few went past that stage to enroll at teacher training institutions or nursing training institutions. It was also because of the colonial politics of that time that blacks were barred from taking certain professions simply because of their skin colour, not the level of education they had. Blacks could never dream of working as medical doctors, lawyers or journalists in their lifetimes. Their professions were supposed to be in teaching, agricultural demonstration and so on. The idea was to ensure that blacks took up low-paying jobs so whites could dominate them economically, and by extension, politically. At the time of the 1948 general strike, Dr Nkomo was working at the Rhodesia Railways (now National Railways of Zimbabwe) as a social worker. That was a fairly senior post, for blacks, who often got jobs as cleaners, scooter drivers, clerks, messengers and the like. He had acquired decent educational qualifications during his time in South Africa in the early 1940s. <img class="wp-image-502534 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Joshua-Nkomo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Joshua-Nkomo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Joshua-Nkomo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Dr Joshua Nkomo Dr Nkomo was a respected professional as a result. By virtue of his decent job, Dr Nkomo had managed to save enough to buy a vehicle, one of his contemporaries; Mr Bango told Chronicle a few years ago. In an interview before he died, Mr Bango told Chronicle that as the general strike took hold, the trade unionists, travelled to the Njelele Shrine to see spiritual guidance. But, said Mr Bango, none of the union leaders of the time had a vehicle. So, said Mr Bango, they had to look around for a car to hire or simply asked for someone to lend them one to enable them to travel to the shrine. They looked and looked around, but failed to get one. That was until they approached Dr Nkomo, who gladly agreed to help them with the vehicle. Together, they went to the shrine where they got the guidance they needed to prosecute the nationwide strike. So apart from being a nationalist, Dr Nkomo was also a trade unionist of note. He managed to secure support from fellow trade unionists in the late 1940s to be elected to senior labour posts. The confrontational strategy that Dr Nkomo, Mr Bango and their fellow black unionists used to address their workplace grievances was to transform into a more robust effort to fight for the political independence of the country in later years. In 1951, Dr Nkomo became the leader of the African National Congress of Rhodesia. But the minority white regime of the day banned ANC. The banning of the party did not extinguish his nationalism and that of his peers as in 1960, at the formation of the National Democratic Party (NDP); he was elected its president.
Like its predecessor, the NDP was banned. In 1962, Dr Nkomo and other political figures formed the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (Zapu). Again Zapu was banned on September 20 1962. Frustrated with the suppression of political expression in the country, Dr Nkomo decided to form a government in exile. However, the move did not go down well with his fellow comrades.
Zapu split in 1963 and Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu) was formed. On 16 April 1964, Dr Nkomo was arrested, detained and spent the next 10 years at the notorious Gonakudzingwa detention camp, in the inhospitable southeastern Lowveld. On his release in 1974, Dr Nkomo left the country to lead the armed liberation war, using Zambia as the base of the Zimbabwe People’s Revolutionary Army, which he led as its commander-in-chief. His efforts and those of the people he commanded and the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (Zanla) defeated the Rhodesian army of Ian Smith, forcing the recalcitrant minority leader to the negotiating table. This led to a series of talks at Malta, Geneva and Lancaster and the attainment of Independence on 18 April 1980. Prior to Independence, Dr Nkomo had led his party, Zapu to the country’s first democratic election, and came second after Zanu. He became the country’s first Minister of Home Affairs. On 22 December 1987 he signed the Unity Accord that ended civil disturbances in Matabeleland and parts of Midlands and took up the post of Vice-President of the country. He championed unity, peace and national development in that capacity for 12 years until he passed on 1 July 1999.
