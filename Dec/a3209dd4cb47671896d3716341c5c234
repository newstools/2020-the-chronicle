South Africa-based DJ Zandimaz who was in Bulawayo yesterday for an appearance says she cannot believe that her song Emathandweni which features Nokwazi has gained so much popularity and has become one of the December hits. The Amapiano track whose video was released in October has over 1.8million views on YouTube. At one time, it was number four on Shazam. Since the track’s release, it has been topping radio charts in Mzansi and Zimbabwe. DJ Zandimaz (real name Zandile Mazithulela) who hails from Esigodini was in the city to celebrate the success of the record with local fans at a local nightspot. She said the love she has been receiving from fans has been awesome. <img class="alignnone wp-image-524098 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/DJZ1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/DJZ1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/DJZ1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “It’s really overwhelming I won’t lie. The amount of love I’m receiving from people who are effortlessly loving my song is so much. They are graciously loving it and it’s so amazing. “Sometimes it’s unbelievable because I ask myself if this is me, an Esigodini girl who is in almost all the top charts. Just last Saturday, I was number two in the Metro FM top 40,” said DJ Zandimaz. She said the song has been doing well across the Limpopo and even in Namibia. <img class="alignnone wp-image-524099 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/DJZ2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/DJZ2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/DJZ2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The song isn’t big in South Africa and Zimbabwe only, it’s also big in Namibia. It’s so amazing, it’s like God is doing the most in my life right now hence I came home to celebrate this feat with my people,” she said. The musician who has played alongside South Africa’s Busiswa, Trademark, DJ Pepsi, Maphorisa and Uhuru paid tribute to Nokwazi saying she embodied her character in the song. “Nokwazi is very versatile and she’s actually one of the best vocalists in my book. I love the fact that she was very open during the recording and allowed me to put in my personality into the song,” said DJ Zandimaz. If all goes according to plan, the DJ said she will release a track titled Umgqibelo that was co-produced by the late rapper, Cal Vin. <img class="alignnone wp-image-524100 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/DJZ3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/DJZ3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/DJZ3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspired by DJ Zinhle, DJ Zandimaz started her career in 2014. She holds a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of South Africa. – @bonganinkunzi
