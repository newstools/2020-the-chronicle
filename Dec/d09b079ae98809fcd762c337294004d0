ZANU-PF leadership in the Matabeleland region has implored the nation to embrace unity and diversity as the country celebrates the 33rd anniversary of the Unity Accord signed between the late former President Robert Mugabe and the late Vice President Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo in December 1987. Soon after independence, the country went through some political turmoil that ended following the signing of the Unity Accord. The Unity Accord is credited for ending Gukurahundi in Matabeleland and parts of Midlands province. Zanu-PF Matabeleland North provincial chairman Cde Richard Moyo said Unity Day is a culmination of concerted efforts by the country’s leaders to put political differences aside and focus on building the nation. “This is a special day which signified unity for the people of Zimbabwe. It reminds us of the efforts that our leaders such as the late Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo and Cde Robert Mugabe put in uniting us as Zimbabwe,” he said. “I therefore urge Zimbabweans, particularly those in my province, Matabeleland North to cherish unity which brought about peace in our country,” said Cde Moyo. He said for a country to prosper there must be peace and political stability. “For a country to prosper and enjoy its natural resources, there has to be peace and political stability. Under the Second Republic, there has been tremendous developments and in Matabeleland North a lot is happening in terms projects, which are benefiting local communities, and this is because of the prevailing peace in Zimbabwe,” he said. Cde Moyo also denounced regionalism and tribalism saying the two devils hamper development and economic growth. “We are what we are today because of the Unity Accord signed on December 22 in 1987 by President Mugabe and Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo. We should put our differences aside and unite for the purpose of developing our beloved country, which was won through a protracted struggle against the colonial regime,” he said. “Zimbabwe is a country of cultural and tribal diversity and Unity Day is such a special day that reminds us to embrace each other as a nation.” Zanu-PF Matabeleland South provincial chairperson Cde Rabelani Choeni said the Unity Accord was all about uniting Zimbabweans regardless of their tribe or race. “We should also celebrate Unity Day, which is a very special day to all peace-loving Zimbabweans. It is important to respect this day which was born out of the zeal and quest to unite the people of Zimbabwe by our leaders President Mugabe and the late Vice-President Joshua Nkomo,” he said. Cde Choeni urged people to shun tribalism and work together for the betterment of the country. Zanu-PF Bulawayo interim chairperson Cde Obert Msindo said Unity Day was a special day that every Zimbabwean regardless of their political affiliation ought to cherish. He said there was also a need to teach youths on the importance of Unity Day. “Unity Day is a very important day especially to the youths and therefore they need to understand its significance and how it came about,” said Cde Msindo. He said the party has lined up speakers comprising, among them, the party’s Politburo member Cde Angeline Masuku and liberation stalwart and veteran nationalist Cde Jane Ngwenya to share their experiences as part of the Unity Day commemorations at Davies Hall. Cde Masuku was part of the team from PF Zapu that participated in the negotiations that led to the Unity Accord.
“We have invited some of our leaders both at national and provincial level to deliver speeches on this special day as we celebrate Unity Day as Zanu-PF in Bulawayo. This is a special day for all patriotic Zimbabweans,” said Cde Msindo. Beitbridge Senator Cde Tambudzani Mohadi said unity is vital to every Zimbabwean irrespective of one’s political party. She urged all people across the country to take this day seriously as the peace and development the country is enjoying is as a result of the Unity Accord. Cde Mohadi said people on Unity Day should take the opportunity to reflect on the journey travelled since 1987. “It is important to commemorate Unity Day as it is the day that our political leaders under the stewardship of the late former President Robert Mugabe and the late Vice President Nkomo put the interests of the country first when they decided to unite,” she said. Cde Mohadi said the Unity Accord resulted in an even distribution of resources. “Every province has a state university, irrigation schemes are being rehabilitated all over the country and major roads linking our towns and cities are also being upgraded and these include the Beitbridge-Harare highway,” she said. Cde Mohadi said unity was key to economic development and urged citizens to shun tribalism and racism which she said were weapons used by the West to divide the people. — @mashnets
