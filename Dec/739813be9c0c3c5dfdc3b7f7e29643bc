NDOLWANE Super Sounds front man Martin “Big Boss” Sibanda is closing the year on a high note following his release of a collaborative single with Congo Brazzaville Music engineer, Freddy Tondele. The track is called Bolingo Yamama which means a mother’s love. The Big Boss who is based in South Africa, announced the latest development on Friday on his social media pages.
“After going through the sourest year, I’ve decided to end it with this gift which is going to be available on all digital stores before the end of 2020,” he said in a video clip. The Ndolwane leader said the single is a mixture of kwasa kwasa, rhumba and amapiano. “We mixed two genres, kwasa kwasa and rhumba and spiced it up with amapiano. In this song, I talk about mothers’ deep love. I value my mother so much and I can never compare her to any other woman. She has a special place,” he said. The Big Boss said he met Freddy in 2012 and worked with him on two of his albums. The Congolese has been working behind the scenes with different musicians as a music engineer and producer. If all goes according to plan, Sibanda said the song must be out before December 30. “We are planning to record a video for the song so that people will understand it by watching the visuals. I know I’ve not done many videos for my songs but this is about to change. My fans should just bear with me because konke kuzolunga.” Sibanda said fans should look forward to his forthcoming album that he hopes to release in March. “I always take time to work on my productions because I want a perfect product. The fans will definitely enjoy this album I am working on,” said the Big Boss. After his fallout with Charles Ndebele in 2011, the Big Boss released his debut solo project Bakhuzeni in 2012. He followed it up with Konke Sizokulungisa in 2016. – @themkhust
