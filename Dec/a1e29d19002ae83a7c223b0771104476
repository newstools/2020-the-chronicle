When I tried to retaliate, he pulled out a knife and stabbed me three or four times on the shoulder and part of the chest,” said Mr Nyawiyanga. He said the boy lost $10 to the robbers. Mr Nyawiyanga said the attack lasted for a few minutes and he managed to free himself and fled while pleading with vendors who were around to intervene. “The guy who had been attacking me joined his friends in beating up Blessing and they later stabbed him leading to his death,” he said. @RaymondJaravaza
