ZIMBABWE wicketkeeper-batsmen Brendan Taylor is the country’s highest Test ranked batsmen, according to the latest International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings released on Monday. The 34-year-old is ranked 30th with 599 points and is joined in the top 100 by three other Chevrons players. Middle-order Batsman Graig Ervine is ranked 46th with 549 points, while all-rounder Sikandar Raza is 61st with 487 points and Reggis Chakabva completes the list of Zimbabweans in the top 100 in 96th place with 337 points. Former Australian captain Steve Smith leads the Test batsmen ranking with 911 points ahead of New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson, who hit a match-winning double hundred against the West Indies in Hamilton to move up a rung and join Indian captain Virat Kohli in second place. The Chevrons are likely to play their next Test match in early 2021. They are set to face Afghanistan in two Tests and three T20Is on neutral territory likely to be India before Ireland visit the Southern African country for three ODIs and as many T20 matches. Pakistan are also set to tour Zimbabwe in April 2021 for two Tests and three T20s. The Chevrons’ ICC Super League fixtures with Australia and India are likely to be played in the second half of next year. Zimbabwe were meant to tour Australia and host India. — @innocentskizoe
