CONTROVERSIAL Bulawayo-based pool player Clemence Gutse, who was slapped with a suspension early this year for faking his father’s death in a bid to swindle unsuspecting members of the billiards family, was crowned champion of the fourth edition of the Peter Dziko Memorial Tournament. The late Dziko was a renowned master of the billiards, who was influential in nurturing young pool players, and instrumental in the formation of the Bulawayo Pool Association (BPA). Gutse, who plays for Starton Lounge Pool Club, beat other 50 players for the first prize in a tournament held at the reopened, The Legacy Bar. Ex-Entumbane Pool Club player Ashton Moyo, Exchange coach Terrence Mhindu and Mike Mutsvedu emerged second, third and fourth respectively. One of the Dziko’s sons, Osborne, said: “It was a good tournament and we are looking forward to holding a tournament for teams for the fifth anniversary. Unlike this year where we had a players’ invitational contest, in previous years winners of the BPA Cup automatically became champions of the Peter Dziko Shield.” The tournament was graced by BPA president Fortune Tawengwa, BPA player representative Stephen Osaka and ex-BPA president Patrick Taziwa. “The late Dziko owned a lot of pool tables in the city after venturing into the business in the late 1990s. He was a fine and modest businessman. We learnt a lot from him and he was a unifier. The tournament helped us remember his good deeds,” said former BPA executive committee member Donald Wadawu.
