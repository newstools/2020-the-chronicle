The Chronicle Michael Schumacher is receiving treatment which has been tailored to help the Formula One icon “return to a more normal life”, according to his former boss and close friend Jean Todt. The German legend is still fighting to overcome the devastating injuries that have kept him out of public view for almost seven years. Following a skiing accident on the French Alps in December 2013, Schumacher’s condition has been kept a closely guarded secret by his family. FIA president Todt, who oversaw five of Schumacher’s seven titles as team boss for Ferrari, is among just a handful of visitors to see the 51-year-old. And the Frenchman has given a rare update on Schumacher’s condition, revealing that Schumacher continues to receive treatment following his life-changing accident. Speaking to Ouest France, he said: “I am very discreet on this subject. “We all know that Michael had a very serious accident and, unfortunately, it had significant consequences for him. “Since then, he has been treated so that he can be able to return to a more normal life.” Todt also saw Schumacher back in September and revealed at the time: “He is fighting. “My God, we know he had a terrible and unfortunate skiing accident which has caused him a lot of problems. “But he has an amazing wife next to him, he has his kids, his nurses, and we can only wish him the best and to wish the family the best, too. “All I can do is to be close to them until I am able to do something, and then I will do it.” Schumacher, who won 91 races and seven world championships during a glittering career, is widely regarded as the greatest F1 driver of all time. His record of wins was surpassed by Lewis Hamilton this season, before the Briton moved level with him on seven titles at the Turkish Grand Prix last month.
