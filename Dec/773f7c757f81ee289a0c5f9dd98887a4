According to Kudakwashe Takundwa, Vusa Mkhaya’s spokesperson, a few things are left to be wrapped up in terms of the music video. “For the past week, we’ve been working on the musical video for Masiyephambili, a song which was done by Vusa Mkhaya that features various artists. We’re left with four artists who are yet to record their individual footage for the musical video,” said Takundwa. He said if all goes well, the music video will be released next week. The track is a mixture of hip hop, kwaito, spoken word and Afro jazz with the artistes all singing about the beauty of the city.
