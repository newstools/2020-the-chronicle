BULAWAYO residents may find themselves under a provincial Level 1 Covid-19 lockdown if they do not change their careless behaviour which has resulted in increase of Covid-19 cases. Bulawayo is now the country’s Covid-19 epicentre and the Minister for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Judith Ncube is mulling enforcing a lock down just for Bulawayo. The country has a total of 1 734 active Covid-19 cases and 572 of those are from Bulawayo. Speaking during a handover of donations from The First Lady Auxilia Mnangagwa in Bulawayo yesterday, Minister Ncube said it was important for residents to be responsible and stop the spread of Covid-19. Amai Mnangagwa donated groceries to Queen Elizabeth Adventist Children’s Home, Emthunzini Wethemba Children’s Home, Ekuphumuleni Old People’s Home and Edith Duly Old People’s Home. “I appeal to Bulawayo residents to be sober as the global pandemic is with us and so prevalent especially in Bulawayo. Its worrying to see people hanging their masks on their faces and some don’t even bother to wear,” said Minister Ncube. She said people were partying a lot in the city these days forgetting that Covid is deadly and killing millions worldwide. “If such behaviour continues I will definitely recommend that we have a lock down because our cases are worrying and it’s sad because residents are so relaxed,” she said. Minister Ncube called on residents to be exemplary and not take part in shaming the city which is known for being orderly. <img class="alignnone wp-image-523161 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/1st-lady-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/1st-lady-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/1st-lady-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “May we be exemplary and stop making headlines for being the hardest hit when people can easily reverse all this by practicing social distancing, wearing masks and washing their hands,” she said. She warned that in the event people do not change their behaviour she will not hesitate to recommend that the city be subjected to level 1 lockdown restrictions. “We are going to engage the police immediately to ensure no parties are conducted anywhere in the city because we are still a hotspot,” said Minister Ncube. She extended her gratitude to Amai Mnangagwa and promised to give her feedback on other needy homes in the city. “We all own these homes and they are a responsibility of the nation and the province. We extend our gratitude to our mother Cde Auxilia Mnangagwa, thank you so much for giving to our needy homes. May you continue showing us your love as a mother and we will continue to monitor and update you on other needy areas,” said Minister Ncube. — @thamamoe
