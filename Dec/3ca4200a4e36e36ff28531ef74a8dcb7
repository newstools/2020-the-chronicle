CHICKEN INN left-back Xolani Ndlovu remains confident he will bounce back into the Warriors fold after being dropped from the squad preparing for Chan. Ndlovu (24) together with Phenias Bamusi (Caps United), Valentine Musarurwa (Harare City), William Manondo (Harare City), Collins Duwa (Triangle United), and Valentine Kadonzvo (Chicken Inn) were dropped from the Warriors squad on Monday. Ndlovu, who scooped the Chicken Inn’s Players’ Player of the Year and joint Player of the Year last season, said this wasn’t the end. The defender was instrumental in Zimbabwe’s qualification for the tournament after making his national team debut against Mauritius in the qualifiers. “Obviously, it was painful to be dropped at this stage. However, these are some of the hurdles you encounter as a player. I’ll just focus on improving my game. I would not say it was the lengthy period off the field that affected me as we were getting programmes that I followed strictly. I personally feel that I have to work harder to get back to full fitness,” said Ndlovu. “The most important thing for me is to work on my shortcomings, mainly the defensive part of my game. I believe if I can work on that aspect of my game, I will be back in the national team fold in no time,” he said. Meanwhile, FC Platinum players that had been excused from the Warriors’ camp are expected to join the squad yesterday just for an assessment before their Caf Champions League match on Wednesday. The players include Petros Mhari, Ralph Kawondera, Kelvin Madzongwe, Perfect Chikwende, Stanley Ngala and Brian Banda. The Warriors lost 2-3 to Dynamos in a training match yesterday. They face Bulawayo Chiefs today before taking on Herentals tomorrow. The Chan tournament starts in Cameroon on January 16. – @innocentskizoe
