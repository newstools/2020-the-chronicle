HIGHLANDERS midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku and all FC Platinum players have been dropped from the Warriors’ Chan squad that resumes training in Harare this afternoon. A squad of 23 players dominated by Caps United and Ngezi Platinum Stars, who provided five and six players respectively, was released by Zifa yesterday and will be in camp from today until departure for the tournament that runs from January 16 to February 7 in Cameroon. Masuku and six FC Platinum players, goalkeeper Petros Mhari, defender Raphael Muduviwa, midfielders Kelvin Madzongwe, Ralph Kawondera, Silas Songani and Stanley Ngala, were not on the list released by Zifa yesterday. FC Platinum players were possibly dropped because of their participation in the Total Caf Champions League. “This still remains a provisional list; the final squad for Cameroon will be announced on December 30,” said Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela. The Highlanders’ trio of goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda and defenders Peter Muduhwa and Andrew Mbeba made the list. The Warriors are in Group A alongside hosts Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Mali. They kick off their campaign against Cameroon on January 16, with Burkina Faso their next opponents before wrapping up the group matches with a tie against Mali. Warriors squad
