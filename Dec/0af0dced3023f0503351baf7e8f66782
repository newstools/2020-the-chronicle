IN what will be a huge slap in the face for the national football association, the December 19 annual general meeting hangs in the balance  amid claims of another postponement.

The December 19 meeting was announced on December 2, just 17 days earlier instead of the mandatory 60 days notice.

The executive has also hinted towards the postponement but no reasons have been proffered so far although our suspicions are on the manner in which this meeting (December 19) was announced, remember the notice was given by the communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela instead of the chief executive officer Joseph Mamutse,” said a well placed source within the national association.
