ON Tuesday the Zifa communications department released a statement announcing that nine Warriors players had tested positive for Covid-19 but it later emerged that five members of the technical staff had also tested positive. This is perhaps the reason why training was immediately halted because there was no one to conduct the sessions. The Warriors who had taken a Christmas break, had regrouped on Sunday to resume preparations for the upcoming Chan tournament set for Cameroon from January 16 to February 7. Tournaments such as Chan provide a perfect opportunity for players to be scouted by bigger clubs from better paying leagues and no player in his right state would jeopardise such a chance by being reckless for just under a week when a lifetime opportunity is on the horizon.
