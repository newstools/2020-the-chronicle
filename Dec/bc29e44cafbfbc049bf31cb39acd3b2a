NATIONAL Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) director of coaching, talent identification and development Lisimati Phakamile says the just-ended marathon runners’ camp in Vumba was a learning curve for participants. Naaz is hoping all marathon runners that took part in the training camp qualify for the rescheduled Tokyo Olympic Games. A decision was made on March 24, 2020, to postpone the Tokyo Games for the first time since the Second World War due to a continued surge in Covid-19 cases worldwide. The games are now scheduled to take place in July next year. While qualifying competitions for track and field as well as race walk events opened in September, qualifying events for the marathon races only opened on December 1 and the national association is pushing for marathon runners to take part in qualifying events as early as next month. The two-week training camp in Vumba was attended by 10 athletes under the guidance of coaches Cephas Pasipamire and Collin Makaza assisted by Phakamile. The athletes have since shifted base to Harare where they will continue training before taking a short Christmas break. “It was a fruitful camp as the athletes really put in the work. There were a lot of lessons learnt from the terrain and environment in the Eastern Highlands. “The athletes are appreciative of the efforts put in by the association to get them ready for next year when they participate in early qualifying events,” said Phakamile. Marathon runners expected to make the qualifying times are South African-based Rutendo Nyahora, Ethel Sibanda, Munyaradzi Jari as well as the pair of Isaac Mpofu and Ngonidzashe Ncube. As part of efforts to ensure the safety of athletes at the Olympics, each of them must provide a negative Covid-19 test taken less than 72 hours before arriving in Japan where they will be tested “every 96-120 hours” during the Games. – @innocentskizoe.
