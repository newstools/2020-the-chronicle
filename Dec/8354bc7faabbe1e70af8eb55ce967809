ZIMBABWE Cricket (ZC) is holding Under-19 trials to select a squad to work with in preparing for the 2022 ICC Under-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup. Fifty-six players are taking part in the trials at the ZC Under-19 Week that started in Harare on Sunday and ends today. The trial event is part of ZC’s national Under-19 squad selection process to build a strong side for the Under-19 World Cup to be held in the West Indies. The trialists were picked during provincial trials ZC organised earlier around the country. A few other schoolboys based in South Africa and the United Kingdom are also taking part in the trials. The trials are being overseen by a selection panel consisting of convener Moses Chitare, Gavin Ewing, Pollock Mubobo and coach Prosper Utseya. The players were divided into four teams under the guidance of experienced development coaches. Bernard Mlambo is in charge of Easterns, Reginald Mutare (Northerns), Alois Tichana (Southerns) and Johnson Marumisa (Westerns).
