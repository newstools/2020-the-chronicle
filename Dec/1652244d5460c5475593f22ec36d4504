The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE rescheduled Liquor Hub Fun Run will now take place on January 10. The sixth edition of the fun run had initially been scheduled for December 6, but was postponed to ensure organisers to comply with Covid-19 protocols. Organisers were advised that it would be difficult to control people in the city centre where it normally takes place. It usually starts and ends at Liquor Hub Store along Fife Street, next to the market place, but organisers have now switched it to an alternative route in the Belmont industrial area. “The event was given the green light to be held on December 6 and the SRC has again cleared it to be held on the 10th of January 2021. The good news is that we will have this event twice in 2021; that is in January and in December,” said Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairman Watson Madanyika. “We are not using the traditional route due to the Covid 19 pandemic, but we are using a route in the industrial area. I would like to thank the sponsors for opting not to cancel the event, but showing passion in supporting athletics and sports in general by allowing us to seek an alternative route,” he said. The liquor Hub 10km run is one of the Bab flagship events and usually brings down the curtain on their season, but will now be the 2021 season’s opener. Registration is in progress at Liquor Hub Store, with fees pegged at US$5 or $500 for seniors, US$3 or $300 for juniors and US$2 or $200 for the charity walk. Winners in the men’s and women’s races will pocket R5 000 each. – @innocentskizoe
