HIGHLANDERS head coach Mandla Mpofu has admitted that replacing striker Prince Dube will not be an easy task.
Bosso sold Dube to Tanzanian side Azam in August. The striker scored 11 goals for Highlanders in all competitions in the 2019 season. He found the net seven times in the league and four times in the Chibuku Super Cup competition that Bosso went on to lift. Dube has been in fine form for Azam this season, netting six goals before sustaining an arm injury that has sidelined him. He is among the top scorers in the Tanzanian league and has reportedly attracted interest from some European clubs. While Bosso have lost Denzel Khumalo, Brian Banda, Tinashe Makanda, Mitchel Katsvairo, Chris Mverechena and Colin Mujuru, among others, it is Dube that Mpofu feels will be more difficult to replace. “Of course, we can’t replace Dube, but we will try our best to get someone who will fit into his shoes, come in and score goals for us. There are players we are talking to; big names are definitely coming, but I cannot reveal names as that will jeopardise negotiations,” Mpofu said. He said he was retaining most players from the 2020 squad and was hoping that when football finally resumes, Highlanders would be among the top teams. Bosso recently acquired utility player Winston Mhango, whom Mpofu feels will bring experience to the side, having played in Zambia and for champions FC Platinum. The Bulawayo giants are also making a move for 18-year-old Young Warriors player Lexington Mujokoro, whom Mpofu described as a great player. “I took the youngster to Cosafa last month; he is a very talented player and with the exposure he will get here, I doubt he will stay for long,” Mpofu said.
