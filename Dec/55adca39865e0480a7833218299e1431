CHICKEN Inn midfielder Guide Goddard says the departure of Clemence Matawu will place more responsibilities on him next season. Matawu (38), who announced his retirement from playing this month, was one of the three Gamecocks’ rotational captains with Moses Jackson and Goddard. “Playing alongside Matawu was a special honour. Matawu was a natural leader and it was very special to be in the position of team captain with him. He made the job easy for us and hanging up his boots means I now have more responsibilities at the club I have served for 11 years,” said Goddard. “There are obviously more responsibilities, but I think that’s a natural thing. You’ve got to try to lead in certain ways and I will try to be myself.” Goddard (32) understands what the Gamecocks badge means. “I have been protected and pampered by this club and have even been taught life skills. In that regard I have to reciprocate and seek to do well for the Gamecocks. While I still have a couple of seasons to play, I’m also eyeing acquiring some coaching badges so that I can groom some youngsters. I was afforded a chance to play Premier Soccer League football when I was young, meaning someone had spotted my potential, thus I also want to develop future stars,” he said. Goddard was part of the 2015 Chicken Inn championship winning squad with Jackson, Matawu, Passmore Bernard, George Majika and goalkeeper Pride Zendera among others. The club is now home to the nimble-footed Bret Amidu, ex-Ngezi Platinum Stars’ trio of goalkeeper Donovan Bernard, defensive midfielder Tinashe Chipunza and defender Liberty Chakoroma, winger Malvin Gaki, former Dynamos attacking midfielder Valentine Kadonzvo and central midfielder Sipho Ndlovu. – @FungaiMuderere
