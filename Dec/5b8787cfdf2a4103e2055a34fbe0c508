While updating the nation on the country’s Covid-19 response and containment measures at State House in Harare on Saturday, President Mnangagwa warned against unnecessary travel and large gatherings over the festive period. The country, said the President, was staring at losing out on the gains made in containing a widespread outbreak of the coronavirus if Zimbabweans continue to disregard Covid-19 containment measures that include enforcement of physical distancing and wearing face masks. President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was party to the World Health Organisation-led Global Access Facility — Covax — which plans to secure and distribute millions of doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to developing countries once licensed and approved. The initiative, which seeks to secure at least 220 million doses, will enable the fast and equitable distribution of the vaccines. Provisionally, the WHO distribution mechanism seeks to proportionally allocate doses until all countries have enough doses to cover 20 percent of their population. “The WHO, working with other global immunisation partners, has come up with a Covid-19 Global Access Facility (Covax). “While a vaccine is the ultimate preventative measure, it is not yet available to us just yet. Preparations for the deployment of vaccines, once approved, are however, in progress guided by two national preparedness assessments conducted in October and November 2020. Zimbabwe will only roll out vaccines that have been analysed and found to be effective and safe for our population,” said President Mnangagwa. He said Zimbabwe was also participating in clinical trials and vaccine research to ensure that the country’s decision is guided by local science.
