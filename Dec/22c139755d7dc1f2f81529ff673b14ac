Yesterday was Cal Vin’s birthday and his mother, Sinikiwe Luphahla visited the rapper’s grave at Lady Stanley Cemetery to lay flowers. Cal Vin (real name Mgcini Nhliziyo) who died at the age of 35, was buried on November 1 after being involved in a mysterious hit-and-run accident a few metres from their home in Bulawayo’s Luveve 5 suburb on October 24 this year. Two months down, his friends and family are still hoping to get closure as they are waiting for the police to bring his killer to book. In an interview yesterday, Cal Vin’s mother said in memory of her son, she decided to visit his grave on his birthday. Asked about the future of Kontrol Tribe record label which Cal Vin operated from their home, Luphahla said they would decide its fate next year when they dispose of his property. “His property will be disposed of after three months from the date of his burial so we’re still waiting. His clothes and property, azikachithwa (haven’t been shared),” she said. Luphahla said in the meantime, the family has removed the studio’s equipment from his room for safekeeping. “For the sake of security and to ensure that his music isn’t lost to thieves, we’ve removed all the stuff from his room. We realised that if the stuff remains in there, people will try and come to steal it. “We then saw it best to remove his stuff and put it somewhere else for safekeeping.” Kontrol Tribe member, Mawiza said they have since looked for alternative places to record in the meantime as they await the way forward from Cal Vin’s family. “We’ve been told that we’ll only be able to access the music that we recorded with Cal Vin after three months,” said Mawiza. Kontrol Tribe comprises of Mawiza, GTi, Dee Vox, Msiztoz Mfanafuthi and Adrien. Meanwhile, Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abedingo Ncube yesterday said investigations of Cal Vin’s case are still on. — @bonganinkunzi
