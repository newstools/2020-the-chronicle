POLICE have launched a manhunt for a man who fatally stabbed a fellow imbiber following a misunderstanding over parking space in Kwekwe. Mr Alison Stambuli (43) was stabbed to death by a fellow patron at a shebeen in Mbizo Section 17 after the two argued over parking space. Midlands police confirmed that they had since launched a manhunt for a man identified only as Magwangu for allegedly fatally stabbing Mr Stambuli. Magwangu fled and left his vehicle, a Toyota Runx, on the scene after discovering that Mr Stambuli had died.
Midlands provincial police spokesman, Inspector Joel Goko said on Saturday at around 8.30PM, Mr Stambuli parked his vehicle, a Honda Fit, at a shebeen in Mbizo 17 where he was drinking beer. The accused person also came and parked his vehicle, a Toyota Runx in front of the gate thereby blocking the entrance. Mr Stambuli later approached the accused person asking him to move his vehicle as he wanted to leave. “The accused refused resulting in a misunderstanding between the two. Mr Stambuli then slapped the accused person twice on the face. The accused went to his car and came back armed with a knife and stabbed Mr Stambuli once on the chest,” said Insp Goko. Magwangu fled leaving his vehicle behind. Mr Stambuli’s son, Alois received a call that his father had been stabbed and was bleeding profusely. Alois, with the help of other residents, rushed his father to Kwekwe General Hospital where he was pronounced dead on admission.
