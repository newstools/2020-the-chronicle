The Chronicle Gareth Bale is set to miss “a few weeks” with a calf strain, says Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho. The 31-year-old picked up the injury during Spurs’ 3-1 Carabao Cup quarter-final win over Stoke before Christmas. Bale has made 11 appearances, scoring three goals, since returning to Spurs on loan from Real Madrid in September. “I wouldn’t say it’s serious,” added Mourinho, whose side play Fulham in the Premier League on Wednesday before taking on Leeds on Saturday, 2 January. Spurs then face Brentford in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup on 5 January, and travel to Marine in the third round of the FA Cup on 10 January. Reports in the Spanish press in recent days claim Real Madrid fear Bale’s loan spell is not going well enough to prompt Tottenham or any other club to take the Wales international on a permanent deal and he may return to the Bernabeu next season. Bale’s contract with Real is worth a reported £650 000 a week, until 2022. Real would prefer to use the money to recruit new players with Paris St-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe and Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Braut Haaland both linked. – BBC Sport
