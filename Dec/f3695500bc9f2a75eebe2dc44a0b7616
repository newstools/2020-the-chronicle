The Minister of Information, Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services has said digital inclusion can only thrive where communities identify with the available digital content, especially in their mother tongue. Speaking during the commissioning of Filabusi Community Information Centre (CIC), on Monday, Minister Jenfan Muswere said digital inclusion is dependent on the availability of content in local languages and dialects. “I therefore cannot over emphasise the need for the development of local content if this CIC is to make the desired impact among the local communities. I therefore call upon local community of Filabusi to start identifying local content that could be digitalised and be made available through the internet for the benefit of the local community”, said Minister Muswere. He said growth in the ICT sector can only be achieved when there is a large pool of qualified personnel in different spheres of the ICT industry. “I therefore call upon the youths of Filabusi to take up studies in different disciplines in the ICT sector and to make use of the facilities we are commissioning today to conduct research when doing their homework and when preparing for their examinations,” he said. Minister Muswere said access to ICTs and effective participation in the digital economy remain critical in improving the quality of life for all the people of Zimbabwe.
