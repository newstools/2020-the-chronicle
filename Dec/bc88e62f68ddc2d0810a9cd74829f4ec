Thembinkosi’s colleagues yesterday took the opportunity to celebrate his life in style by driving through the streets parading their Honda Fits and blowing horns as the burial was in progress. The drivers who did not join the funeral cortege from Pumula South, had their own procession which started at Nketa Six Garage and drove through the streets ending at Athlone Cemetery. <img class="alignnone wp-image-522963 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Send-off3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Send-off3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Send-off3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A Chronicle news crew spoke to one of the deceased’s peers who only identified himself as boss KD who described the murder of Thembinkosi as callous. KD who also owns a Honda Fit, said following the death of Thembinkosi, they were now living in fear given that the suspects were still on the run. <img class="alignnone wp-image-522964 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Send-off4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Send-off4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Send-off4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “These people are now posing a danger to us as Honda Fit drivers and the generality of transport operators because they haven’t been caught. Our fear is that any one of us could fall victim to these murderers because we depend on being hired for a fee,” he said. Many of Thembinkosi’s friends and relatives could not witness the burial due to the Covid-19 restrictions which do not allow gatherings of more than 50 people. <img class="alignnone wp-image-522967 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Send-off6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Send-off6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Send-off6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thembinkosi went missing on December 1 and his mutilated decomposing body was only discovered on Sunday buried in a shallow grave near Mananda Dam along Solusi road. The vehicle he was driving is yet to be recovered.
