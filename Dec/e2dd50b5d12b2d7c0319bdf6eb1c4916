The Chronicle THE Premier League have announced a record 18 cases of coronavirus in the latest round of testing after Manchester City and Sheffield United were hit hard. The most-recent round of testing saw 18 players and staff members return a positive Covid-19 test, up from seven last week. A total of 1 479 players and staff were tested for the virus. The previous record was 16 positive results for the week between November 9 and November 15 — early on in the second lockdown. Man City’s game against Everton was postponed, with the current total of 18 positive results up from 11 last week, although Sheffield United’s clash with Burnley this evening is still set to go ahead. Southampton will be without their manager Ralph Hasenhuttl for their match with West Ham, however, after a member of his household tested positive. Newcastle and Man City have both been badly affected by coronavirus in recent weeks. Scheduled for Monday evening, City’s clash with Everton was called off just hours before kick-off. Kyle Walker and Gabriel Jesus both returned positive Covid tests, as well as two members of staff. But it’s feared the virus has hit at least HALF of the squad following their trip to London to take on Arsenal in the Carabao Cup last week. At least three more Man City players have contracted coronavirus. In a statement, Etihad chiefs said: “The club returned a number of positive cases, in addition to the four reported on Christmas Day. “This posed a risk that the virus could spread further amongst the squad, the staff and potentially beyond.” The Premier League said: “The Board agreed to rearrange the game as a precaution.” Sheffield United also revealed several cases ahead of this evening’s trip to Burnley — although the game WILL still go ahead. – The Sun
