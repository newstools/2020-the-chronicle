Released on Monday morning with captivating visuals that were produced by Vusa Blaqs, the song is likely to be a hit among many as it is all about letting loose and merrymaking. Jah Prayzah who plays role of a pilot is captured partying the night away with his flight attendants. So hectic is the partying that the crew fails to wake up in time, delaying their master who then calls and tells them not to provoke him, explaining the song’s name. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-522470" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Poro...jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="810" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Poro...jpg 1080w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Poro..-360x270.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Poro..-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Poro..-680x510.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /> The video was released on YouTube where it was viewed by over 2 000 people during its premiere at 10AM.
