Sikholiwe Ngwenya of the Roman Catholic Church in Hwange Diocese but based in Port Elizabeth in South Africa said she was happy to be back home after being stuck in the neighbouring country for five months. “It’s good to be back home. I was supposed to come in July from P.E where I am based but there was no flight. I was super-excited when I heard about this flight and had to catch the first one. However, the fear of the virus is still there and I hope we will be able to prevent it as you know that travelling is not safe,” she said. Mr Eugein Euler from Johannesburg could not hide his joy of visiting Victoria Falls for the first time. He said he was visiting Victoria Falls to celebrate his 60th birthday and is in the company of two friends Ms Elisabeth Wimberge and Mr Allan Prentce. Mr Euler’s birthday was on the 20th of November. “It’s so wonderful to be on the first flight and to be in Victoria Falls as it is my first time to be here. I am here to celebrate my 60th birthday with my friends and we will be here until Sunday. This is a beautiful place and already we love it,” said Mr Euler. In a statement, Fastjet said it was excited to be back. It will operate three times a week on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday. “We are pleased to introduce the convenience of a direct flight service between the two cities. A visit to Victoria Falls offers visitors to Zimbabwe the tranquil opportunity and escape into the wonders of nature, which does not come much more spectacular than Victoria Falls,” said the airline management. Hopes are high in the tourism sector for a boost in domestic and regional arrivals as operators expect resumption of flights and opening of borders to bring clients. The country opened Beitbridge, Plumtree, Victoria Falls, Chirundu and Forbes border posts on Tuesday before adding Kazungula on Wednesday to allow private vehicles and pedestrians to start travelling. “Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe national vice chairman Mr Farai Chimba said it was up to the tourism industry to leverage on the positives taking place in the country. “The opening of skies continues to endorse preparedness to reopen and receive international and regional travelers. We commend the efforts put in place to combat Covid-19 and ensure health safety guidelines, which gives confidence for revival of the industry. We must leverage on these positives,” said Mr Chimba. -@ncubeleon
