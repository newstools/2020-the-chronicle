The year 2020 is one year that most people would want to quickly forget due to the Covid-19 pandemic’s disruptions of every facet of life. Countries worldwide were forced to enforce lockdown restrictions meant to curb the spread of the pandemic thereby forcing people to change their way of life. Artistes were the most affected as entertainment activities were among the first to be suspended. What is however, encouraging is that to some artistes, the Covid-19 challenges were in fact opportunities. The forced confinement gave them ample time to work and perfect their craft. Interestingly, this was also a year that most underground and up-and-coming artistes made names for themselves through sharing their works online. Most people spent greater part of their time at home browsing the Internet thereby giving artistes a good opportunity to showcase their works online. The artistes were therefore guaranteed audiences on various social media networking sites as people spent many hours browsing the Internet daily. Below are some of the up-and-coming artistes in the Matabeleland region who were unearthed this year. <img class="wp-image-524706 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/lee.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/lee.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/lee-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lee McHoney aka Mai Noku Who can forget the Wadiwa Wepamoyo online local drama that captivated the hearts of many Zimbabweans at the start of the lockdown?
