THE Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe is rolling out an “Eradicate Human Error” campaign to curb road accidents this festive season and has urged motorists to avoid embarking on unnecessary driving. Many road accidents are recorded during the festive season. The Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Council is conducting a safety awareness campaign countrywide to save human lives.
The campaign is running under the theme “Eradicate Human Error”. The council is rolling out educational campaigns, conducting highway patrols and joint operations with the Zimbabwe Republic Police, the Zimbabwe National Road Administration, among others. In an interview, Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Council’s acting Director Operations, Research Marketing for Bulawayo Mr Ernest Muchena said they are embarking on a number of measures to curb road traffic accidents and protect human life this festive season. “To ensure maximum safety for all motorists we are carrying out highway patrols and conducting awareness campaigns to equip road users with the necessary safety information meant to reduce human error when driving. Members of our council are at roadblocks in conjunction with police particularly on major roads leading into and out of cities, educating motorists to exercise extra caution when driving,” said Mr Muchena. He said most road accidents were as a result of human error which means they can be avoided. <img class="alignnone wp-image-523400 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/9999.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/9999.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/9999-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Most fatal accidents that happen in our country are as a result of human error which means we can avoid them as motorists. Some of those accidents are as a result of drinking and driving while others are due to fatigue. An average of five people are killed every day and these fatal road traffic accidents are attributed to human error. It is our duty to be on the ground carrying out safety awareness campaigns especially ahead of public holidays like Christmas and New Year,” said Mr Muchena. He said motorists should avoid travelling at night as most accidents happened at night. “Driving vehicles under the influence of alcohol and night driving are the major catalysts of fatal accidents. During public holidays like this coming festive season, people are excited hence the many accidents recorded on our roads,” said Mr Muchena. He urged drivers to avoid speeding, night driving as well as drinking and driving. “We have also partnered with Zimbabwe National Road Administration (ZINARA) to spread the safety message to motorists,” said Mr Muchena. He said during the rainy season some rivers are flooded, roads are slippery and there is poor visibility, hence all road users should be extremely cautious to avoid accidents. Mr Muchena appealed to motorists to adhere to traffic road rules and regulations to minimise accidents this festive season.
