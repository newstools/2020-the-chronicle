The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Manchester United’s French midfielder Paul Pogba has committed to staying put at the Red Devils while also seemingly taking a jibe at United legends Roy Keane and Garry Nevile who both told the club to ditch the Frenchman on TV on Saturday night. According to Dailymail, the former United captains laid into Pogba, saying that the club should get rid of him after an interview was published with the player’s agent, Mino Raiola, last week saying he wanted to leave, the latest of several thinly veiled comments from Raiola suggesting Pogba needed to move. However in a late night post on his Instagram after United’s nil all home draw against neighbours Manchester City, where he had a great game, the World Cup winner said when people don’t know what was going on behind the scenes, it was best not to talk. He said he was ‘1000 percent’ involved and ‘all has been clear between the club and myself.’ “I’ve always fought and will always fight for @manchesterunited , my teammates and the fans. Bla bla is not important. The future is far, today is what matters and I am 1000% involved! Always strong together.. all has been clear between the club and myself and that will never change. When you don’t know what’s going on inside don’t talk   #SpeakTheTruthOrRemainSilent #united #talktothehand”wrote Pogba.
