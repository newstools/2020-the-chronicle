Following news of the release of this album, which Master KG said was a teaser of his major album that will be released next year, some quizzed why he was releasing songs from his EP including Jerusalema again. He responded saying: “Let me teach y’all. Deluxe means upgrade. It’s like upgrading an old thing so I upgraded the old album with new songs. This means a new album will drop next year.” <img class="wp-image-521724 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Nox-with-Master-KG-and-Tyfah.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Nox-with-Master-KG-and-Tyfah.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Nox-with-Master-KG-and-Tyfah-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nox with Master KG and Tyfah However, whether people like it or not, the deluxe album is coming and it’s what people are going to find themselves dancing to over the festive season.
