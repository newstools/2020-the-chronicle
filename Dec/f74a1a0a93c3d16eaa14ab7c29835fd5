The Chronicle Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates will be allowed to face their Angolan opposition in Caf competitions next week despite the country’s decision to close their borders to South Africa. Last week the Angolan government imposed a land, air and sea borders ban for passenger travel to and from Australia, Nigeria, South Africa and the United Kingdom due to the emergence of a variant strain of Covid-19 emerging from those respective nations. However, with Chiefs and Pirates scheduled to face Primeiro de Agosto and Sagrada Esperanca in the Champions League and Confederation Cup second-leg ties respectively, an exception is set to be made. Amakhosi, who drew 0-0 with the Girabola giants at FNB Stadium last Wednesday, are set to travel to the Estadio 11 de Novembro in Talatona while Josef Zinnbauer’s side will host Esperanca at Johannesburg Stadium with an away-goal advantage. “The (government) will open an exception because of these international competition protocols,” former Director of the Angolan Football Federation Dino Paulo tells KickOff.com. “It will not be just for those matches but every match for countries’ entry in the list of restrictions. In other words for all continental sports competitions.” With the ban intended to avoid inbound travellers susceptible to potentially bringing new infections to the Southern African nation, who are attempting to prevent a “second wave”, leading publication Journal de Angola also confirmed the Minister of Sport had addressed the issue of international sport. It has been suggested there will be no postponements or cancellations of any fixtures for Caf competitions nor any international sport despite the government’s decision. – Kick off.com
