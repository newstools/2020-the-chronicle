HEALTH experts have warned that “it will end in tears” if members of the public do not adhere to prevention measures during the festive season. The festive season is synonymous with merry making — where friends and families converge to celebrate the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. It’s a period when members of the public usually throw caution out of the window as festivities take centre stage as people, some who might not have not seen each other over a long period, set aside their busy schedules to relax, wine and dine while winding off the year and celebrating the new one. However, 2020 has been a difficult year in which social distancing, wearing of masks, sanitisation of hands and minimising gatherings have become the order of the day to prevent the spread of Covid-19 which has ravaged the world, disrupting normal life as it has been understood. As communities, families and individuals celebrate the Covid-19 prevention regulations remain relevant especially as more people are dying due to the global pandemic. Since the country recorded the first Covid-19 death in March, 2020, until Saturday a total of 12 963 individuals had been infected by the virus, 10 519 recovering from it while 341 succumbed to the disease as active cases stand at 2 103. Already some countries have tightened lockdown regulations to cover the festive period amid fears that this period could trigger a new wave of infections. Health experts have since urged members of the public not to let their guard down on Covid-19 prevention measures.
They have raised concerns that the merry making season could turn into anguish should citizens fail to adhere to Covid-19 prevention measures noting that there is a new Covid-19 variant which is still to be understood, albeit it is considered to be deadlier. Mpilo Central Hospital acting chief executive officer Professor Solwayo Ngwenya said in view of the Covid-19 threat and a new strain that has already been recorded in South Africa, members of the public should exercise caution. <img class="wp-image-481653 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Dr-Solwayo-Ngwenya11-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Dr-Solwayo-Ngwenya11-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Dr-Solwayo-Ngwenya11-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Professor Solwayo Ngwenya “During my previous warnings we had a weak virus, so now with the advent of a new variant Covid-19 virus which is now being recorded across the border, it’s worrying because it could come with those visiting the country. So, we face very perilous times and they have to heed the warning as a lot of people could end up dying. The reason being that after mixing and enjoying Christmas, if people are not cautious, they will be very, very sick and hospitals will not be able to cope with the new variant of the virus. So, members of the public really need to think about what they are doing and these could be life and death situations, especially on who they see and party with,” said Prof Ngwenya. National University of Science and Technology Faculty of Medicine Deputy Dean Dr Wedu Ndebele said:
“They must take every precaution, no large gatherings, no parties because that is where they become more vulnerable as they start drinking and ignoring all the rules. <img class="wp-image-507832 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Dr-Wedu-Ndebele.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Dr-Wedu-Ndebele.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Dr-Wedu-Ndebele-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Wedu Ndebele We already know that there is new strain in South Africa and a lot of visitors are coming through so I’m sure the strain will end up being here. This disease is now killing even children so people must observe all the regulations and wear their masks whenever they are in a public space and make sure that they wear it properly covering the mouth and the nose.” He said the new Covid-19 strain is more easily transmitted than the one which had been around since March. “In terms of causing deaths and complications, we are still to understand the dangers of this strain. But what people should understand is that you can still contract Covid-19 and have no symptoms but can transmit to others that can have the symptoms,” he said. Bulawayo City Council health services director Dr Edwin Sibanda said what is required to stop the Covid-19 infections is for members of the public to stop moving and entertaining people into their homes. <img class="wp-image-524342 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Edwin.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Edwin.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Edwin-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Edwin Sibanda He said with a deadly Covid-19 strain being recorded in South Africa it was worrying that a lot of people were coming to Zimbabwe, some with invalid Covid-19 certificates. “Our fear is that a lot of people might come through the borders with Covid-19 already. If you are looking at the number of people that are coming into the country through the Beitbridge Border Post as we have seen through the media, people are spending three to five days there when they must be tested and should report here within 72 hours,” he said. “But if you spend five days in Beitbridge by the time you get here the certificate will already be invalid meaning that you could have contracted Covid-19 along the way and you might arrive here with symptoms. There is also this other group that could bypass the system we have heard through social media that there are people who pay their way into the country without any certificates. So, all these things we are very concerned that they will end up making our situation worse.” Dr Sibanda said while 90 percent of the country’s Covid-19 cases are due to local transmissions, the situation could change with the new arrivals. He said:
“We hope that they do not bring this new strain that is rumoured to be more deadly so more people may lose lives. So, people should stick to the laid down guidelines of preventing and minimising Covid-19 infections.” He said if Bulawayo records a spike in Covid-19 cases, it could affect isolation and quarantine facilities in the city.
