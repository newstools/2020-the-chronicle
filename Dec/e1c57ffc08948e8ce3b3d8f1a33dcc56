MATABELELAND South province is slowly becoming a powerhouse in the arts sector and this was evidenced by the successful hosting of the second edition of The Eminent in Sports, Music and Academic Awards (Tesma) last weekend. The awards which honour outstanding artistes, athletes, students and teachers from the province were held on Saturday evening at Gwanda District Club. They saw organisers defy odds as they hosted a fete that was well attended by artistes, athletes, students and teachers. Bhadilah was the toast of the event as he scooped three gongs for Best Collaboration Song for his Vhavenda track that features Bolamba Culture Birds Best Video and Song of the Year for Nkonela. Closely following Bhadilah was Bry who clinched two awards in the Best Reggae category for the track Tears of the sun. His latest album, Tears of the sun earned him the Best Album of the year award. Other winners on the night were South Africa-based producer Lance Hebron who is well known for producing Novuyo Seagirl’s AEIOU hit, veteran poet Ngqindi who was conferred with the Lifetime Achievement Award while Kadder won the Best Kwaito artiste. Event organisers, Educational Foundation Trust through their CEO Sikholiwe Sibanda said the event was a success. They said they were already planning the third edition of the awards where they hope to introduce two international awards, Best International Act and Best International Artiste as they grow the event. “We’re happy everything went well and we’d like to thank everyone who played their part in the successful hosting of this event,” Sibanda
