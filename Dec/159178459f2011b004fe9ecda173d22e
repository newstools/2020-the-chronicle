THE national Under-20 men’s football team arrived in South Africa yesterday ahead of their opening Cosafa Championship tie against the hosts at Wolfson Stadium in Port Elizabeth tomorrow. Zimbabwe are making a return to the competition after missing last year’s competition. They have been drawn in a tough pool that also includes Mozambique and Lesotho. Only the top team from each of the three pools and the best-placed runner-up advance to the semi-finals, while the two sides that will compete in the final will earn a place in the 2021 Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations in Mauritania. With the disqualification of the Under-17 national team from the Cosafa Championships a fortnight ago still fresh, there is hope Zifa covered enough ground this time around to avoid the embarrassment that came with the banishment of the Under-17 side. Botswana, Comoros Islands and Eswatini were also excluded from the competition after one or more of their players failed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) eligibility assessment on their arrival in Nelson Mandela Bay.
