The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter REIGNING Mr Zimbabwe Men’s Physique, Ryan Gumbo, says he decided not to take part in the Harare Classic competition to pave way for young and upcoming talent. The Harare Classic made a return at the weekend after an eight-year absence, and drew participants from around the country. Athletes competed in the open men bodybuilding, junior men bodybuilding up to 70kgs, Under-23 bodybuilding, open men’s physique, open men’s fitness and open women’s bikini fitness. Gumbo, who is preparing for the Arnold Classic scheduled for South Africa next year, said the Harare Classic proved that there was vast talent in the country that only needs to be supported. The Arnold Classic was supposed to take place in May this year, but it was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and will now be held from May 14-16 next year. “It was a tough line-up and it proved that there is so much promising talent out there. It is our duty to motivate more guys to come on stage, which is why l did not compete to give these guys room to showcase their talent,” said Gumbo, who also sponsored the men’s physique category. “Giving back to the community is something I always looked forward to, knowing that I am where I am today because l came through this same channel.” Harare Classic 2020 Results Senior men bodybuilding Men’s Physique Men’s Fitness Junior men bodybuilding Women Bikini fitness
