LIFE has not been the same for Victoria Falls residents without their Zambian neighbours, popularly known as omzanga. Traditionally, people from Victoria Falls and those from Livingstone town across Zambezi River share similar history as the majority are from the same Tonga, Tokaleya, Nyanja and Lozi backgrounds. Victoria Falls and Livingstone residents have over the years continued to interact without much limitations as those with relatives on either side would cross the border at any given time to visit each other. Even those without relatives cross the border for shopping or for casual visits with friends taking advantage of availability of one-day gate passes. Under normal circumstances, Victoria Falls residents would have easy access to the border even without passports as they can use one-day gate passes obtained from the immigration department upon production of valid identification documents. Zambians from neighbouring Livingstone town would also cross on a daily basis using similar documents to sell various kinds of products such as tomatoes, vegetables, green mealies, second-hand clothes and shoes among other goods. The Covid-19 pandemic, however, cut that umbilical cord as it led to the closure of the border. The reopening of borders for private vehicles and pedestrians early this week brought smiles on the faces of many citizens although the joy was short-lived after it emerged that only those with Covid-19 negative certificates are allowed to exit or enter the country. For cross-border traders, and mostly vendors and residents from border towns such as Victoria Falls, the reopening of the border brought joy. Around this time of the year, omzanga usually would be selling green mealies, okra and fresh groundnuts in Victoria Falls. Victoria Falls residents are nostalgic as they miss crossing into Zambia and accessing various kinds of products from the neighbouring country. “We miss omzanga,” says a Victoria Falls vendor who only identified herself as MaNyathi. She sells roasted maize and green mealies at Mkhosana Shopping Centre. MaNyathi says Covid-19 has taught people to trust each other. “We used to buy things from omzanga. I was so happy when I heard that the border had opened but became sad when I was told that one needed a Covid-19 negative certificate to be able to cross. We are vendors and we survive on selling vegetables and farm produce which we are currently getting from Bulawayo. “This is expensive for us because of transport costs and distance. Things were cheaper before Covid-19 because we could buy from omzanga or cross to buy from Livingstone. We really miss omzanga and wish this disease could end so that we go back to normal life and borders open,” said MaNyathi. MaNyathi however, said the coronavirus unleashed some hidden traits in people. “Covid-19 taught us a lot of things; to share, give and trust each other. Things have been tough but we have managed to pull through. We pray that it comes to an end so that we go back to normal lives,” she said. Another resident Mrs Sibusisiwe Dube from Mkhosana, Victoria Falls said informal traders are the worst affected. “We the informal traders are the worst affected because we survive on buying and selling. We pray that Government reduces the cost of Covid-19 tests so that we can afford to cross the border,” she said. A senior citizen Mr Pechie Lungu said the lockdown had evoked sentimental moments among Victoria Falls residents and their counterparts across the Zambezi River. “Those who are old enough may know that we used to cross to Livingstone unhindered for medical treatment and general visiting. This lockdown period made us realise how important we are to Zambians and them to us. Even without any trade taking place, the mere fact that we are visiting each other keeps us going because our history and values are just similar,” said Mr Lungu. Regional Immigration officer for North-Western Region Mr Vincent Mukombero said the strict border control is aimed at ensuring health and safety. <img class="wp-image-521148 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Mr-Vincent-Mukombero.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Mr-Vincent-Mukombero.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Mr-Vincent-Mukombero-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Vincent Mukombero “We are just following the normal Covid-19 protocol and the Ministry of Health and Child Care will be guiding us on that. One needs a valid passport and valid negative Covid-19 certificate which they will present to the port health before they are referred to the immigration,” said Mr Mukombero.
