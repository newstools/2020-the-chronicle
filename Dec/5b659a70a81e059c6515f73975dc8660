House-kwaito exponent Diliza who has been down due to health issues, says he is back in the game after two years.
Diliza has been suffering from a chest infection and his doctor had advised him to stop performing. The man who fronts South African Kwaito group Stiff, which is popular for the Umcimbi hit, has now been given the green light to resume performances. It was a pleasant surprise seeing him on stage at the recently held Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAA) where his energetic performance was among the outstanding performances. Recounting his RoilBAA experience, Diliza said he is glad to be back on stage after his recovery. “At first, I was nervous as the five minutes I was given to perform felt like a 45-minute set. But I enjoyed every second of it. Being on stage was a great experience, I had missed it and I also loved the crowd’s response. “The other thing which gave me confidence was performing on home ground.” Diliza is back with a bang and is on demand. On the same day he performed at the RoilBAAs, he had another booking in South Africa where he was supposed to share the stage with Professor. “I was supposed to be in SA for a show with Stiff but when I got an invitation to perform at the awards, my crew from Stiff suggested that I perform in Zimbabwe saying they would handle the Durban show,” said Diliza. To show that he means business, the artiste is already in studio working on a project with Stiff. Locally, he is working with Rebellious Suhnz with plans to work with the likes of Msiz’Kay and Tebza next year.
