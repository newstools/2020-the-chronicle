Opening up after the fact about how Covid-19 affected him, Cassper lifted the lid on his experience of having the coronavirus while making a virtual guest appearance on US radio personality Kojo Ebro’s show. “At first it was a scary part where we stayed home and then I started training. I’m training for this boxing fight. The training was hectic and just at the peak of my fitness, I contracted Covid-19. “The weirdest thing is everybody was social distancing and everything we’re told to do, but somehow I caught it. If I wasn’t called by the person who contracted it, I wouldn’t have known. I just had a little headache, I thought it was from sparring. I thought someone hit my head too hard. I went and got tested and I found out I was positive.” Ama and Brian shared their diagnosis on social media and have all since fully recovered. -TimesLive
