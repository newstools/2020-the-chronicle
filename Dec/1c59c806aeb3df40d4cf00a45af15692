FERTILIZER manufacturing company, Sable Chemicals Private Limited, has partnered Nyaradzo Funeral Services in a project that will see more than 10 000 trees being planted in Kwekwe. Nyaradzo have a target of planting 500 million trees countrywide by 2025. They have also partnered Kwekwe City Council and planted more than 4 000 trees in the city. To commemorate this year’s National Tree Planting Day, Sable Chemicals donated fertilizer, a major component for the project. Each tree requires 500grammes of ammonium nitrate every year. Sable Chemicals chief executive officer, Mr Bothwell Nyajeka, led from the front as he took part in a 35-kilometre walkathon from Munyati River to Kwekwe High School where he planted a tree. “We partnered Nyaradzo in the quest to promote tree planting. As you know, Nyaradzo are on their quest to attain 500 million trees by 2025 and we are coming in to supply fertilizer to promote the initiative,” said Mr Nyajeka. Nyaradzo Kwekwe Branch Manager, Mrs Kumbirai Tavagwisa said so far they have planted 4 000 trees in the district. “We partnered Kwekwe City Council and we have planted more than 4 000 trees. We targeted council schools like Dambudzo Primary, Chana Primary, Tasungana Primary and St Martins Primary among other schools and the initiative is going on well. As a district we are targeting more than 10 000 trees this year alone,” said Mrs Tavagwisa.
