It is a show for the bold, brave, smart and intelligent. The event was founded by Rose Moyo Chigwida who is popularly known as Madam La’Rose. She partnered with veteran modelling instructor, Princess Mercy Mushaninga who is known for hosting Miss Curvy. Madam La’Rose said they initiated the pageant to give male models an opportunity to showcase their talent just like their female counterparts. “As a brand, we thrive to bring out the best and grow the male modelling industry to meet international standards. We have very good male models who need exposure hence we came up with Mr Zimbabwe. “As we grow the concept, we intend to assist our models to take part in every reputable contest,” said Madam La’Rose. Last year’s winners were Devson Takudzwa Luzaine from Gweru (Mr Zimbabwe), Ben Chest (Brand Ambassador), Tatenda Njunike of Harare (People’s Choice) and Ishmael Muragandi who was capped Mr Zimbabwe Prince. – @mthabisi_mthire.
