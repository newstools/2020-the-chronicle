TWO more people have succumbed to Covid-19 in Zimbabwe while 174 tested positive on Sunday. The two deaths were recorded in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces. Of the new cases, 20 were recorded in Bulawayo, 97 in Harare, 19 in Masvingo and 18 in Manicaland provinces while five were recorded in Mashonaland Central. The other eight new cases were recorded in Matabeleland North, two in Matabeleland South, four in Mashonaland East and one in Midlands province. The Ministry of Health and Child Care says the new cases bring the total number of active cases to 1 981 in Zimbabwe. “We recorded two deaths and 174 new cases in the last 24 hours and all the cases are from locals. “As at 20 December 2020, Zimbabwe had 12 325 confirmed cases, including 10 024 recoveries and 320 deaths,” said the ministry. As part of efforts to fight Covid-19, last week, President Mnangagwa donated 1 000 litres of hand sanitiser and 500 masks to Khami and Bulawayo prisons. The two prisons early this year made headlines for being Covid-19 hotspots in Bulawayo, with 25 prison guards and 76 inmates testing positive to Covid-19 at one point. The hand sanitiser and masks were donated to the President by the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) last month. The donation was handed over to the two prisons by Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Minister Judith Ncube. Speaking at the ceremony, Minister Ncube commended Nust for producing certified sanitisers which have been distributed countrywide to fight Covid-19. “Nust students and members of staff are doing us proud as a province and country as they are contributing a lot to fighting the spread of the pandemic. “This donation by the President will go a long way in minimising the exposure of both inmates and prison staff to the pandemic,” said Minister Ncube.
