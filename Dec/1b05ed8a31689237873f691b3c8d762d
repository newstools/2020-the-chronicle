The Chronicle Three teams look set to progress in the African Champions League without playing the second legs of their preliminary round ties. GHANA’S Asante Kotoko, Algeria’s Mouloudia Alger and Mali’s Stade Malien are all set for places in the last 32 of the tournament. Mouloudia’s game against Buffles on Friday did not go ahead after the side from Benin were unable to travel to Algeria. The tie was evenly balanced at 1-1 after last week’s first leg in Benin. Asante Kotoko and Stade Malien’s games were cancelled after positive Covid tests left their opponents with less than 15 players in their squads. Confederation of African Football amended its regulations for Covid to say that teams with less than 15 players would not be able to play continental club games. Guinea’s AngloGold arrived in the Malian capital Bamako with 17 players and when four of those tested positive for Covid-19 on arrival it left a squad of just 13 players leading to the game being called off. However AngloGold dispute the results of the tests done in Mali. Stade Malien held a a 2-1 lead from the first leg last weekend. It was a similar story in Ghana where Mauritania’s Nouadhibou had two of their 16-man squad return positive Covid tests on arrival and saw that game called off. Nouadhibou also disputed the results of the tests carried out in Ghana. The first leg in Nouakchott had ended in a 1-1 draw. The winners of the ties in last 32 will progress to the group stage of the Champions League while the losers will drop to the play-offs in the Confederation Cup.
