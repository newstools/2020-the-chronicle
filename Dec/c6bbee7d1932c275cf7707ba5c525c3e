In an interview yesterday, the Bulawayo-based musician who has had a great year, featuring on numerous collaborations that have changed the game said being shortlisted on the international music channel was a big thing. “This is a big thing to be on the same list with these big names. I’m the only hip hop artiste and this shows that I’m heading in the right direction with my music. Besides the big names, just being acknowledged on this platform alone is a big deal. “I’m looking for votes from people and fans and encourage people to support me in this journey,” said Asaph. His music video for the song Like So has been receiving a sizeable amount of airplay on the internationally recognised MTV Base channel.
