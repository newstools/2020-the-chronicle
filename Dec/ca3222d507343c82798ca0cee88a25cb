ZIMBABWEANS have been urged to remain vigilant and continue observing Covid-19 rules and regulations announced by President Mnangagwa amid indications of a new variant of coronavirus in South Africa. A new variant of the coronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible, has been discovered in the neighbouring South Africa and is being blamed for a new surge in Covid- 19 cases in that country. Though it emerged independently, it features a similar mutation to the new variant discovered in the United Kingdom that scientists say is more transmissible, prompting many nations to ban travel from Britain. South Africa’s health Minister, Zweli Mkhize, said that the new variant appeared to be linked to higher rates of severe illness in younger people and scientists are working to learn more about it. With this new variant on the country’s door step, the deputy Minister of Health and Child Care Dr John Mangwiro urged Zimbabweans to continue observing the Covid-19 rules and regulations announced by President Mnangagwa in March so as to curb the spread of the new virus in the country. He said members of the public must be careful all the time and practice the new normal of putting on face masks, practising hygiene and social distancing. “What must be done by our people in the wake of the new variant in other countries like South Africa is to strictly adhere to recommended health protocols,” said Dr Mangwiro. He called on people to report to the police any people who break the Covid-19 restrictions. “We must all be our brother’s keeper, report any incident in the community where people disregard Covid-19 restrictions,” said Dr Mangwiro.
