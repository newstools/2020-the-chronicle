The Chronicle Joel Tsvakwi
SOUTH Africa-based Zimbabwean Tshibilika artiste, Perfect Tsheba Mvundla better known as Khudu has released a new album. Khudu from Tsholotsho, who fronts the Tsheba boys Abafana Baka Jiyane band, made his maiden entry into the music industry in 2008. He is now a seasoned artiste who is basking in the glory of 11 albums. His latest offering, Iganga yiAnswer which has seven tracks, seems to have been received well judging by the airplay and feedback it is receiving. “I’m very happy with the manner my fellow Zimbabweans based in South Africa especially in the Limpopo province and those back home are supporting my music. I’m indebted to Dumezweni and Mazilankatha boys, Toddy Moyo and Mlambos Express Band as they greatly assisted me when I started my journey in a foreign land,” Khudu said. Most artistes were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic as they could not produce or stage shows but for Khudu the story was different because the lockdown gave him ample time to work on new songs. “Things were difficult but the lockdown made me discover my strengths. During that period I managed to come up with a quality Tshibilika sound, something that’s been confirmed by the rave reviews the latest album is getting.” Songs on Iganga yiAnswer which were produced by TK Dube at his studios, are receiving fair airplay on local stations, Radio Zimbabwe and Khulumani FM. Songs on the album are Sekuyiskhathi, Kanti Uyinyoka, Kulelizwe, Ungamthembi, Ngijabulisa Abantu, Abantwabami and the title track.
