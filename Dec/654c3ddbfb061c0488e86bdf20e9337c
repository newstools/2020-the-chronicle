At the beginning of the year, renowned music producer and DJ, Stavo fired warning shots that people were sleeping on Asaph, the Mambo hit-maker after he was not awarded at the Zimbabwe Music Awards. Asaph had been nominated in the Best Hip Hop artiste category and lost out to Takura. “Zim is sleeping on Asaph. He’s going to go far. He is hip-hop in Zimbabwe. We fail to support true talent. He deserves more attention and more awards, trust me,” tweeted DJ Stavo in January. And true to his words, months later, many are now seeing and appreciating Asaph’s talent following his successful collaborations this year. From Msiz’kay to Ammara Brown, Crooger, TiGonzi, Nutty O all the way up to Gemma Griffiths, Asaph collaborated with numerous artistes. And these were not just mere collaborations, they produced bangers from 263, Calling, Ginde to Back to December, some which are still trending up to now. Asaph’s shortlisting this week by MTV Base, an international music channel which is considering him for their People’s Choice category at the MTV Africa Music Awards could not have come at a better time. It has shown all those who did not believe in him that he has what it takes to conquer not only Zimbabwe, but Africa. After all, it seems DJ Stavo was right, people were sleeping on Asaph and he is now out to prove his worth. Below are some of Asaph’s 2020 highlights: “We’re going to make it by fire by force, toita zveGinde,” Asaph declared on the track showing how hungry he was for success.
