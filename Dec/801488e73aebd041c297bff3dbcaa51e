BULAWAYO beauty Tatenda Ruby Manungo is thrilled to be representing Zimbabwe at an international pageant after she was crowned the Top Model at the Miss Intercontinental Zimbabwe competition last week. The event held in Harare earlier this month was hosted by former beauty queens Tendai Hunda and Hilda Mabu.
For winning, Tatenda, 20, will represent Zimbabwe at the Top Model of the World contest to be held in March next year in Egypt. A product of City’s Favourite Models (CFM) agency, Tatenda said she was overjoyed and looking forward to representing the country on a global stage. “I was happy (to be crowned) as I didn’t expect it honestly. It’s something big because Miss Intercontinental and Top Model of the World are rated among the top five beauty pageants,” said Tatenda. The former Girls College and Dominican Convent High School pupil who is a tourism and hospitality student, said she started modelling at the age of 15. Miss Intercontinental Zimbabwe was her first pageant. “I began modelling at the age of 15 and was groomed by Fingers modelling school. Now I’m under CFM modelling agency,” said Tatenda. The beauty who has walked the Mpumalanga Fashion Design Week ramp in South Africa and also attended fashion events — iFashion Fest; ADNP Fashion, Summer Fashion Awards (Zim) and Intwasa Fashion show, said former Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Samantha Tshuma inspires her. Shadel Noble, a CFM representative said they were proud of Tatenda’s achievements. “She is a very competitive young lady who’s very intelligent. We knew she was the right candidate to represent us and her province and we’re very proud of her as she brought the title home,” said Noble, who is also a model of note from the city.
