A miner at Jena Mine in Silobela, Midlands Province died after a tunnel he was working in collapsed on him. The miner, whose name could not be ascertained by time of going to print, died on the spot while several others escaped with injuries. One who was critically injured was rushed to Kwekwe General Hospital where he is receiving treatment. Authorities at the mine and police could not be reached for comment. Silobela MP Cde Mthokozisi Manoki-Mpofu confirmed the incident. “It is true, one person died at Jena Mine after a tunnel collapsed, injuring many others. As we speak, I am on the ground and co-workers and other villagers are trying to retrieve the body of the deceased,” said Cde Manoki-Mpofu. He said the level of safety at the mine has been worrisome of late. “Safety is being compromised at the mine and we need to look at the safety of workers. We need to engage the mine authorities so that they step up safety and precaution measures because there is nothing as precious as life,” said Cde Manoki-Mpofu. The fatality is the second in three months. In October, another miner died after he was chocked by chemicals after entering the mine shaft soon after blasting.
