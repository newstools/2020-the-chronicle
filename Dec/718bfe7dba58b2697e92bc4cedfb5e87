The Chronicle Mamelodi Sundowns have suffered tragedy once again with another player having passed on following yet another car accident. Sundowns have lost one of their star defenders Motjeka Madisha, who passed on on Saturday night. The rising star was involved in a horrific car crash in Kempton Park on Saturday evening, just hours after the clubâ€™s 50th anniversary celebrations. This is the second loss by The Brazilians, who just recently laid former right-back Anele Ngcongca to rest following a car accident in Durban last month.-kickoff.com.
