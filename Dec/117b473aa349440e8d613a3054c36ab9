HWANGE Colliery Hospital has opened a fully-fledged eye unit in partnership with the Eye Institute of Zimbabwe.
The unit will treat patients with eye problems, which range from spectacle requirements to surgical operations. The milestone will result in Colliery staff and the Hwange community accessing specialist eye treatment close to their homes instead of going out of town to access the service. The unit officially opened its doors on Monday. A resident nurse handles all minor ailments and books patients for the doctor’s attention for complex cases. Speaking to Chronicle on Tuesday, Hwange Colliery Company Limited spokesperson, Mrs Rugare Dhobbie said the unit offers affordable eye care. “The Colliery Eye Unit will offer affordable and comprehensive eye care which includes ophthalmological and optometry services. The unit will be staffed by an ophthalmic nurse and highly knowledgeable ophthalmologist who will be present on fortnightly basis,” said Mrs Dhobbie. She said the service bouquet at the new unit included medical for the treatment of eye conditions, examination of the eye, vision and health education while surgery consisted of cataract removal and eye growth among others. In addition, the optometry service at the unit encompasses refraction, prescription and supply of spectacles. “One of our own registered general nurses is currently undergoing training in Bulawayo as an ophthalmic nurse and will complement the staff at the eye centre. This is a welcome development for all our employees and will go a long way in complementing the vision screening currently being carried out at the Colliery hospital’s occupational health unit,” she said.
