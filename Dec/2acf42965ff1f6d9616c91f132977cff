The Chronicle THE newly adjusted Level 3 lockdown regulations have been made official, and the gazette reveals how football in the country will be affected. On Monday night, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that South Africa would be taking a strict approach to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and as such a number of indoor and outdoor activities were banned! His speech, however, did leave some questions, particularly for sport, given that Premier Soccer League matches as well as amateur football were prohibited under Level 3 lockdown a few months ago. But those regulations have since been adjusted following previous consultations between the football authorities and Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa. Players are also believed to be tested regularly by clubs, which will no doubt have to ramp up Covid-19 testing due to rising infections. Numbers at match venues will be limited to players, staff, match officials, security, medical and emergency personnel as well as a few other exceptions. Journalists are also permitted, but the PSL has, surprisingly, so far banned the media from attending live games. What will affect the return of the DStv Premiership in the new year is the curfew after Ramaphosa confirmed there will be no movement in the country from 9pm to 6am, meaning the league has to adjust time slots for evening kick-off. The PSL had already made that change with the first initial curfew of 11pm by moving night time matches to an earlier slot, but the 7pm kick-off will no longer be feasible because there simply would not be enough time for everyone to leave the venue and make it home before the country shuts down. â€“ Soccer Laduma
