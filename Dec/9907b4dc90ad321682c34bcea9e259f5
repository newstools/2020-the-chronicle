TWELVE participants successfully completed a three-day National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) Level 1 coaching course at White City Stadium on Saturday. The 12 participants comprised six women and the same number of men. Kurt Sibako, secretary-general of the Matabeleland North Athletics Board and a qualified World Athletics Level 2 sprint and hurdles coach, was the course facilitator while former Bulawayo Athletics Board chairman Manuel Mpofu, who is now a Naaz administrator and competitions manager, coordinated the course. Bab chairperson Watson Madanyika was pleased with the number of female participants in the programme, saying this was inline with their push for gender equity in coaching and administration of the sport in the province. “As the Bab, we are pleased that most of the participants are from the city of Bulawayo. Our participants came from different communities and institutions, which include schools, colleges and universities. We had six females in this course, which is encouraging because it shows that women are taking coaching seriously. This is also key for women empowerment, not only in athletics but sport in general,” said Madanyika. Among the Bulawayo-based course participants were renowned basketball and rugby coach Theo Weale, Morris Banda, Ndumiso Mabhena, Faith Dube and Lanny Mlotshwa.
