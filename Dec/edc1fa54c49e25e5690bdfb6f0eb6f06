The awards will be broadcast on MTV Base (DStv Channel 322) and MTV (DStv Channel 130). In order to represent Zimbabwe at the awards, Asaph first has to get enough votes through Twitter with the hashtag #ASAPH4MAMA. Voting for the shortlisted candidates closes on January 9. If chosen, Asaph will represent Zimbabwe in the People’s Choice Award. In an interview yesterday, the Bulawayo-based musician who has had a great year as he featured on numerous collaborations, said being shortlisted on the international music channel was a big achievement. “This is a big achievement to be on the same list with such big names. I’m the only hip-hop artiste and this shows that I’m heading in the right direction with my music. Besides the big names, just being acknowledged on this platform alone is a big deal. “I’m looking for votes from people and fans and encourage people to support me in this journey,” said Asaph. His music video for the song Like So has been receiving some good airplay on the internationally recognised MTV Base channel.
