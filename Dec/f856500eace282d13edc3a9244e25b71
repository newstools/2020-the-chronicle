Afro-Pop musician Lord Skeelz and rappers Orthodox Six and Prozac, have remembered Cal Vin with an emotional song and moving music video titled Uhambile that depicts the pain that people go through when they lose a loved one. The music video and track were released yesterday on online streaming platforms as people celebrated the late rapper’s birthday. <img class="alignnone wp-image-522728 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Lord-Skeelz.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Lord-Skeelz.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Lord-Skeelz-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The song was produced by Murphy Cubic while the music video was produced by Rasquesity Kaitse. The music video set in a chapel where a funeral is taking place sees Lord Skeelz in a coffin. As if seeing himself, the next shot sees the musician looking into the coffin sorrowfully crying out that his friend uhambile (is gone/dead). The music video brought back memories of Cal Vin’s funeral service as the three artistes sang about how they had lost a friend. Featured on the video are model Patie Nyathi, Zoe Dlodlo, Clive Chigubhu and Mzoe 7. Lord Skeelz (real name Sydney Chadokwenda) said the track was a dedication to everyone who has lost someone. <img class="alignnone wp-image-522732 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Lord-Skeelz2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Lord-Skeelz2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Lord-Skeelz2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “It’s dedicated to everyone who has lost someone special. We recently lost a friend and are still awaiting justice for his gruesome death. The release was deliberately timed to coincide with the legendary king’s birthday which is 15 December,” Lord Skeelz said. He said December 15 must be declared an arts holiday of some sort as Cal Vin was a legend. <img class="alignnone wp-image-522733 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Orthodox.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Orthodox.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Orthodox-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I believe it (December 15) should be recognised as an arts holiday in memory of King Cal Vin.” Lord Skeelz who did the chorus for Guluva Se7en’s popular Khanda Cool hit said he worked with Orthodox Six and Michael Ndebele (who recently won Best Underground Artiste at the Zim Hip Hop awards), two artistes who have been in the game for a long time. He said it was high time that people started giving people their roses while they are still alive. <img class="alignnone wp-image-522736 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Orthodox1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Orthodox1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Orthodox1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “These two artistes have been instrumental to the craft and deserve to be given their roses while they’re alive. This mentality of waiting for one to die to be appreciated should stop,” said Lord Skeelz. Orthodox Six is known for hits such as Street Child, Rebel with a Cause, Where Am From and his record Sweet November which was turned into a short film that was aired on DStv’s Africa Magic channel. At the recently held Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards, the late Cal Vin was honoured as they renamed the Outstanding Hip-Hop award after him. The award was called The Calvin Mgcini Nhliziyo Hip-Hop Award and was won by Asaph. – @bonganinkunzi
