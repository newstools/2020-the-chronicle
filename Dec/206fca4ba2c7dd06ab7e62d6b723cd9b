The Chronicle PATRICK BAMFORD slammed home a fifth-minute winner from the spot that left Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope fuming. And Pope’s boss Sean Dyche was not exactly a picture of festive fun either over the VAR-assisted penalty decision that helped Leeds to a 1-0 win on Sunday. His mood only darkened after VAR could not be used when it looked like Ashley Barnes had collected a 19th-minute equaliser. The Clarets striker pounced on a fumble by French goalkeeper Illan Meslier, who dropped a cross under pressure from Ben Mee. Barnes pounced on what looked like a basic handling error by the 20-year-old. Yet before his shot crossed the line, referee Robert Jones had already whistled for a foul by Mee — meaning Stockley Park technology could not be used. Jones’ decision on that incident was instant. Just as it was when Pope collided with Bamford, who became the first Englishman to score at least ten league goals in the Premier League since Robbie Fowler in season 2001-02. Pope appeared to make contact with the ball before he and the striker landed in a heap. But just ten seconds after Jones had pointed to the spot, he got confirmation from VAR that he had it right.
Much to Dyche’s frustration. Even so the Clarets boss and his players did have one stroke of luck as Leeds recovered from their 6-2 pre-Christmas hammering by Manchester United. Jack Harrison looked to have slotted home his side’s second goal in the 33rd minute — only for the ball to cannon clear off Bamford. – Sun Sport
