It was third time lucky for South Africa-based rapper Mlungisi “Mlue Jay” Moyo as he finally bagged a Zim Hip Hop Award this past weekend. Mlue Jay who was nominated in the Best Diaspora category for the third time in a row was up against Reck 442, Kap City, Dimitri and the Scarecrow and Neville Sigauke. The Bulawayo-born rapper said it feels good to finally win the award. “I’m happy to have finally won the award. I’d been nominated for three years and finally getting it means a lot to me as an artiste. I’m humbled by this award which actually is my first gong. “This has shown that my works are being recognised at home and it will definitely push me to produce more music and good videos,” said Mlue Jay. He said the win has shown him that anything is possible, something that has made him want to work towards getting a South African Music Award (Sama). Sharing his plans for next year, Mlue Jay said he plans to tour various countries to take his music to the people. “Next year, I’m planning to take my music to another level by touring different countries, Zimbabwe being on top of the list. It’s definitely going to be a busy year.”
