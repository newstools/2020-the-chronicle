Musician and poet, Obert Dube continues to raise the country’s flag high as he was voted the 2020 Pan African Poet of the Year at the Panafes Excellency Awards that were held in Douala, Cameroon on December 9. This was the National Arts Merit Awards 2016 winner’s fourth recognition outside the country after he was honoured in Swaziland and South Africa a few years back. In May this year, he was presented with an honorary Pan African award courtesy of renowned Kenyan Pan Africanist and social analyst Professor Patrick Loch Otieno Lumumba. His 2019 album My Journey earned him a Roil Bulawayo Arts Award this year. Dube had earlier this year won the Pan African Poet of the Year award for his poem Africa which seems to have hit the right chord as it continues to earn him recognition on the continent. The poem’s video was released timely on Africa Day and it went viral. The poem Africa laments some African practices that have been abandoned as people have adopted cultures from other continents which are deemed superior. Commenting on his latest achievement, an excited Dube said this was a confirmation that his work is being recognised globally. “I feel that my poetry is being recognised globally and this has encouraged me to keep working harder in order to achieve more.”
