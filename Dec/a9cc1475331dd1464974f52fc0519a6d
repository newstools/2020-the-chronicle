ONLINE comedy sensation Ray Vines of the Mukukuzvi fame is set to take on former Minister of Energy and Power Development, Fortune Chasi, Chibabest in music circles, in a boxing match as part of their comedy charity event. The event dubbed “Mukukuzvi versus Chibabest” will be held at the Harare International Conference Centre on Boxing Day and will be streamed live on a number of social media pages. World Boxing Federation middleweight titleholder Charles Manyuchi is set to officiate at the event that is expected to kick off at 8:30PM. In an interview yesterday, Ray Vines who started the challenge as banter on social media said he decided to host the real match as a charity cause. The comedian who has been doing philanthropic work of late said the main objective of the fight is to raise money for charity and promote physical fitness, health and wellbeing through boxing and entertainment. “For me, this will be a way of raising money for renovations and equipment for my creative hub (Mukukuzvi) in Gweru that’s meant for artistes’ growth. For Mr Chasi, his intention is to assist young girls in Mazowe South who struggle to attend school due to lack of sanitary wear among other things,” Ray Vines said. With Ray Vines being trained by Action while Chibabest was trained by Vanso, the fight on Saturday is set to be a thriller as both artistes seem ready for action. With Covid-19 regulations and restriction guidelines, only 100 people are expected to physically attend the event. — @mthabisi_mthire.
