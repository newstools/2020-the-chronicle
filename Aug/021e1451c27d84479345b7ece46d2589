FOLLOWING success of the Kasi Pride Battle campaign, Highlanders will next month launch another Twitter campaign under the banner “iTeam Yezwe Lonke”. While the Kasi Pride Battle sought to find out which Bulawayo suburb had the most ardent Bosso fans, the iTeam Yezwe Lonke campaign will seek to find out which part of the country has the most Bosso supporters. The iTeam Yezwe Lonke campaign will give Bosso fans on Twitter an opportunity to vote for the city or town that has the most passionate fans. “We are working on the project. It’s one of the projects lined up for the coming month. We had a successful Bulawayo Kasi Pride Battle edition and we want the iTeam Yezwe Lonke campaign to be even bigger. “While Twitter might not be a true reflection of the entire Bosso constituency, we believe the initiative will help us interact with our fans, at the same time giving our partners an opportunity to profile their brands,” said Highlanders’ communications officer Ronald Moyo. The debate over which suburb houses the most passionate Bosso fans was settled early this month, with Nkulumane walking with the bragging rights. Nkulumane edged Mzilikazi to win the Highlanders Kasi Pride battle. In the final Nkulumane amassed 56,9 percent of the vote while Mzilikazi got 43,.1 percent. For the Kasi Battle, Highlanders partnered with Arenel. Last season, Arenel sponsored the Highlanders’ first team with their Hydro Boost mineral water for training and match days and indications are that the two organisations might be working on a bigger partnership. — @innocentskizoe
