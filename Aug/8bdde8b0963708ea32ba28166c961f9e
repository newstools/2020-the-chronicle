AFRICAN Sun Hotels and Resorts Group has reopened its Caribbea Bay Resort, which was closed early this year in line with the national lockdown rules brought about by the global outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Government has granted the nod for partial re-opening of the tourism sector under strict adherence to health guidelines. And to buttress the sector’s restart after months of business slowdown, President Mnangagwa on Friday launched the National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy and also re-opened the Victoria Falls Rainforest. The reopening of hotel facilities comes with strict adherence to Covid-19 safety measures and guidelines provided by the World Health Organisation to protect stakeholders. In a latest media update African Sun Hotels and Resorts said it used the lockdown period to embark on a refurbishment programme for its properties. It has also re-opened its major hotels under the Holiday Inn brand among other facilities in major cities and towns. The exercise, said the group, saw the completion of refurbishment of 41 rooms in total being upgraded at Caribbea Bay Resort in keeping with modern trends so as to continue “to meet and surpass guest expectations”. To lure clients, the group has since extended a special 50 percent discount on accommodation to guests booking in the month of August as well as a pay for two and stay for three special applicable to the campsites. The resort offers a total of 83 rooms, 41 of which have been upgraded and cater for a diversity of clients including the disabled. Caribbea Bay Resort is located on the shores of the Lake Kariba, a sight more in keeping with the blue waters of the Mediterranean and seen as the heart of Southern Africa.
