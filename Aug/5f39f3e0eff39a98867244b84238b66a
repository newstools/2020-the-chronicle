UP-AND-COMING wheelspinner, DJ Macasette (real name Malaki Dumani) who came out tops at the Toundtainment Events DJs competition held in Plumtree last weekend is working on an appreciation mixtape to thank those who voted for him. For his set which had a touch of the Limpopo Bolo House and deep House beats, the 20-year-old artiste bagged R1 000. He was closely followed by DJs 9 and Que. DJ Macasette said he was grateful for the support he received from the Plumtree community. “I am excited for having won this competition and to thank those who supported me, I’m working on an appreciation mixtape. Once ready, I’ll upload it on Audio Mack,” said the DJ. DJ Macasette who is being mentored by established Plumtree DJ, Yugoe, said he also wants to use the mixtape to promote his works on the digital space. Reflecting on his musical journey, DJ Macasette said he developed a passion for arts while at Thekwane High School where he was involved in organising the school’s entertainment events. “I’m now an MSU student studying towards Banking and Finance. There, I’m part of the Campus DJs Movement which is a students’ group of DJs that is run by DJ Charle Maine who is also a student.” Toundtainment Events has for the past couple of weeks, been promoting up-and-coming talent from Plumtree through giving the artistes a platform to showcase their talents at various competitions that are taking place online. This weekend, a public speaking and poetry competition dedicated to primary schools pupils will be held. “We’ve started recording clips for the public speaking and poetry competition which will be posted on Sunday evening. This time around, we decided to give an opportunity to primary schoolchildren where six of them battle it out for the prize money of R500,” said Toundtainment Events director Handsome Sibanda. – @mthabisi_mthire.
