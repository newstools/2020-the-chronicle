The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter POWER utility, Zesa Holdings, missed its electricity supply target by 20 percent to 1 384,46 Gigawatt hours in the second quarter ended 30 June 2020 against a target of 1 732,56 GWh due to continued technical faults mainly at Hwange Thermal Power Station. In an update the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), a subsidiary of Zesa, said output for the period under review was 38,64 percent below the same period last year. “In the reporting period, ZPC sent out a total of 1 384,46GWh against a target of 1 732,56GWh.  The output is 20,09 percent below target, and 38,64 percent below the output for the same period in 2019,” said ZPC. To date the power generation company has sent generated 2 678,32GWh, which is equivalent to 80 percent of the target for the half year. “Hwange Power Station generated during the quarter sent out 618,44GWh of energy generated from three units, missing its quarterly target by 38,40 percent. This was due to the unavailability of Units 3 and 6, which have been on extended outages due to delays caused by the Covid-19 travel restrictions as well as lack of funding. “Unit 5 was also unavailable throughout the month of June owing to ID fan problems, thus compromising the station’s output,” it said. – @okazunga
