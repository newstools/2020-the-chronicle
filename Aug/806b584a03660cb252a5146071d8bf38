With arts events still on hold in the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic, talented Afro-fusion band, Ngoma Ingoma is utilising this time to work on their second album as well as visuals for their debut album which they released last year. The group signalled its entry onto the showbiz scene with a self-titled nine-track album, Ngoma iNgoma in May last year during a show that was held at the Bulawayo Theatre. Since then, the group has shown its staying power by securing slots at top events among them the Victoria Falls Carnival where they performed alongside BET winner Sha Sha and Prince Kaybee. They also performed at this year’s Zimbabwe Music Awards where they were the house band. During the lockdown, they have been regulars at the Fusion Media Group live shows. The group’s spokesperson who is also the bass guitarist, Blessing Stot-Bass Sitotombe said the forthcoming album will have collaborations with Bulawayo rap king, Asaph who will feature on one of the tracks. Visuals for hit song Amalobolo, Ngifuna Wena and Iwe are currently being shot. “We’re currently working on a studio album, as well as music videos for last year’s songs. We’re halfway through the process and the upcoming album is one fans should look out for. “We won’t rush to release it because we want to fully exert ourselves. We’re grateful for the lockdown as it has given us ample time to work on the project and ensure it’s up to standard,” said Stot. Stot however said the lockdown had made it difficult for them to record some videos and as such, the scripts have to be adjusted.- @mthabisi_mthire.
