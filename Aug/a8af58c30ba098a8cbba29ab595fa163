SOUTH AFRICA-based Zimbabwean gospel musician, Ernest Masongela says his fan base has grown tremendously since his relocation to the neighbouring country five years ago. The soft-spoken musician, who says he was strongly inspired by the late gospel musician Freedom Sengwayo, has released his 12th album titled Ngiyadlula which was produced at Amigos, a new studio that he co-owns with his partner, Ishmael Ntutha. The new album has 13 tracks and one instrumental spicing a song called Sanitiser which encourages the sanitisation of hands in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. In an interview, Masongela said the song also symbolically refers to the sanitisation of humanity from sins as well as quarantining of hearts stained with sinful habits. “Since I came here (South Africa), most people understand the language I use in my albums hence my fan base is growing. My vision is to see new talent recording their music and a legacy of my kind of music being built so I can pass the baton,” said Masongela. “Inspiration is always in me as I always have songs in my heart through Jesus who is inside me.” On this album, he said he featured Virgin Voices of ladies who provided the backing vocals. The keyboards were played by new, untapped talent. Masongela has a strong background in the musical recording industry. He is one of the founders of Harmony Sounds, a male group that was founded in Nkayi District more than three decades ago. The group is popular among Seventh-Day Adventists in Zimbabwe and abroad. His other albums include; Uthando, Ngizodumisa, Umoya we Nkosi, uJesu Uyangihola, Yehla Moya, Ngihlengiwe, Ngifihla Jesu, uHambo Lwami, Linda Ukhuleke and DVD albums Lingesabi and Izono Zisusiwe.
