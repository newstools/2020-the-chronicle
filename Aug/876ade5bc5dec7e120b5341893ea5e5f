ZAMBIA-based Zimbabwe midfielder Winston Mhango could reunite with his former coach Tenant Chilumba as reports have linked the combative anchor man with a move to Forest Rangers. Mhango, whose contract with Kabwe Warriors expires at the end of this month, is in the country following the abrupt end of the Zambian league due to Covid-19. Kabwe Warriors are keen on extending Mhango’s stay but sources close to the player say the former Zimbabwe Soccer Star of the Year finalist is still considering both offers. Mhango moved to Zambia two years ago after being lured by Chilumba at Kabwe Warriors where he instantly established himself as a vital player. Chilumba also coached him at Hwange FC. “Tenant Chilumba is the one who brought Mhango to Zambia and he has a soft spot for him. He likes his aggression and wants him to join Forest Rangers, who will compete in the Caf clubs’ competition after finishing second. Mhango is still weighing both the Forest Rangers and Kabwe Warriors’ offers,” said a source. In his first season at Kabwe Warriors, Mhango inspired the club to finish in seventh place and eighth position this year. In an interview yesterday, Mhango could neither deny nor confirm that Forest Rangers are interested in his services. “The season just ended and I’m here attending to some family matters. It’s been a long season and with my contract having expired, obviously there will be talk about my next move, but I’m yet to make a decision. I enjoyed myself at Kabwe Warriors and they’ve said they are still interested in my services, but like I said, I’m yet to make a decision,” Mhango said. — @ZililoR
