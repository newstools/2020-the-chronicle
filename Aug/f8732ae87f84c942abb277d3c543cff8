BAREfoot goddess Ammara Brown is encouraging people to embrace Ubuntu through her new song titled Glow in the Dark which was released last week. In an interview, the Mukoko hit-maker said the acapella song urges the listener to look beyond the surface of someone’s skin or status and shun from treating Ubuntu like some distant memory. “I love to live my life and I can witness all the world, but I would love to love you truly. Can’t you see that I am human. My heart is just an open door, hoping that you will explore the dark and light inside me. Strip me of my fortune, strip me of my fame, strip me and you’ll find the most glorious things,” sings Ammara. Explaining the song, she said: “I began to write this song while in a relationship. He was questioning me about rumours he’d heard about me and yet ironically, he was a celebrity himself, experiencing similar cyber abuse and such. “I realised I was living in an unnatural cage called fame. The best thing I could do to escape this oppression was explain my humanity in a song. The best parts about me are not my skin or my name. I’m human which means my truth is in my spirit and it shines from within. “In a time when we pass judgment based on our skin and status, it is of paramount importance that we not only remember our Ubuntu, but live it.” The video she said, is simply a gift to spread the energy of peace and humanity. The song that is available on YouTube was produced by the songstress while record producer, Chiweddar was the perfect technical engineer. The visuals were shot at ZBC studios by multi-award-winning videographer Vusa Blaqs with Cook Off movie director, Joe Njagu as the immaculate cinematographer. – @mthabisi_mthire.
