The planned reunion of one of the most popular urban grooves outfits, Mafriq has had to be shelved due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown that has crippled a lot of businesses. The ‘Ndizvo Chete’ hit-makers who made waves at the height of the urban grooves’ movement were hoping to resume live shows together after pursuing solo careers for the better part of the decade. But, the global pandemic has made it difficult for Pauline Gundidza, Tungamirai “Tunga T’ Mavi and Lovedale “Discord’ Makalanga to reunite. In an interview, Discord said besides live shows, the outfit was looking forward to releasing an album that would mark their return. “We were planning on releasing an album and video for the track ‘Ndamuwana’. Ndamuwana is a follow up to ‘Ndizvo Chete’. But sadly, this is not going to happen anytime soon due to the coronavirus so our fans will have to wait a bit longer,” said Discord. He said while some tracks may be recorded, it will not be easy to market and release them due to travel restrictions. “Our industry isn’t considered as essential so we’re not able to hold shows. It was going to be easy to market our music and our return through live shows, but now that’s not possible. However, we promise our fans that we’re working on something and will bounce back as soon as lockdown restrictions are lifted,” said Discord. Besides using their own studio, Mafriq Music Factory (MMF), the group is also working with House of Grooves Studio and their long serving producer, Take 5 as well as other producers like Terrence Ngwenya and Manashe. For now, people can watch some of the group’s virtual performances on YouTube and House of Grooves.
