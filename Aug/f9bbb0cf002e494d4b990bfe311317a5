The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter Jah Prayzah’s first born son, Mukudzeyi Junior who has been showing interest in his father’s trade is set to release his debut single on Wednesday. Mukudzeyi Junior, a few months before the Covid-19 pandemic stroke, had been accompanying his father to some of his shows where he would showcase his singing talent, much to the amusement of show goers.

It seems Jah Prayzah has taken that advice as he yesterday shared news that Mukudzeyi Junior is ready to share his first song with people. “Mukudzeyi Junior in the studio creating magic. I am proud of you son. I can’t wait for the world to hear your talent and voice,” wrote Jah Prayzah as he shared an image of his son in his studio in Harare. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-507961" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/0C121030-8E53-499B-B2E1-BC49738C44FF.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/0C121030-8E53-499B-B2E1-BC49738C44FF.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/0C121030-8E53-499B-B2E1-BC49738C44FF-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
