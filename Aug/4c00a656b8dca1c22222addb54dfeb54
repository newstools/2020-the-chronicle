The Chronicle OVIDY Karuru is looking forward to facing Bafana Bafana. The Zimbabwe international star first arrived in South Africa to play for Kaizer Chiefs in 2014 before later moving to AmaZulu and now Stellenbosch FC. He remains a stalwart of the Warriors squad some 13 years after making his debut and has had a huge impact on the Cosafa Cup in the past, including a remarkable six goals as Zimbabwe romped to the title in 2017. He told The Cosafa Show of his plans for the rest of this season at Stellenbosch FC, with the league set to restart on August 11, as well as his thoughts on the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup qualifiers. “We have been waiting to play (Bafana Bafana),” Karuru said of the World Cup preliminary games. “We always want to play against South Africa because when we are here (in the Premier Soccer League) at our clubs, we always talk about it. “We have missed the Battle of Limpopo! That one is going to be our toughest game because neither team wants to lose. When it comes to Ghana and the other team (Ethiopia), we just have to go there and get a result, then we take them on in the reverse fixture at our home ground. “But against South Africa, there is no home, no away, with so many guys playing here (in the PSL). It is going to be a tough one.” Meanwhile, Lesotho national team head coach Thabo Senong is a year into the job and he updates on progress with Dikwena. He twice led South Africa to the Fifa Under-20 World Cup, but has now turned his hand to senior national team football and improving the football of Lesotho. They are a nation that often punch above their weight and he is relishing the challenge. The Namibia Football Association are going through a turbulent time and recently expelled their Premier League as a member, leading to an overhaul of club football in the country. — Soccer Laduma
