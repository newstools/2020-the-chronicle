SEVEN-year-old Luyanda Sibalo has defied the odds and made her love for music known publicly after she made her debut music appearance on her uncle, gospel musician, Daniel Sibalo’s single titled Zvakaipa Zvose. The gospel single which will be released on Friday will be available on a number of digital platforms. It talks about the evil things people do which will be exposed when Jesus Christ comes. It was produced by Mozy Solidgrace Gavaza and recorded at Good Sounds Studios in Windsor Park, Ruwa. Unlike most artistes who have pointed out how they started their arts careers at a tender age, but only blossomed in their middle age, Luyanda wants to expose her talent at an early age. In a video that has been doing rounds on social media, the soft-spoken Luyanda expresses how the instruments on her uncle’s single stimulated her to put her vocals. <img class="wp-image-508120 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Daniel-Sibalo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Daniel-Sibalo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Daniel-Sibalo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Daniel Sibalo “I went to studio with my uncle and what attracted me the most were the instruments. I fell in love with them and put my vocals on the part that my uncle gave me. I was also astonished with the way my voice sounded and blended well with the instruments,” said Luyanda. She said she hopes people will love the song and her fingers are crossed that she will soon record her debut solo single as her love for music is growing. “I’m looking forward to having my solo single. The recording of Zvakaipa Zvose inspired me as my uncle worked very hard to get it done. Seeing the single cover which is a picture of me and my uncle also makes me proud and shows me that I can do it.” Sibalo said he roped in the services of his younger brother Ndabezinhle’s daughter because of her immense talent. The Bulawayo-based artiste said the song is a cry to God to forgive people for their wrongdoings. “I’m crying to God to forgive all my sins and wrongdoings, pleading with Him to cleanse me and direct my path so that I become Holy. In the song, we also talk of what will happen to sinners when Christ comes. How they will run up and down looking for salvation, but it will be too late so people will cry, but with no help,” Sibalo said. The musician started his musical career professionally in 2017 and has two albums to date, Have Mercy oh God and Coming from the Cold which features Missiondom Sengwayo. The artiste’s love for family saw him pay tribute to his late brother, Brian through a song called Ndirimufambi where he worked with Comfort Manyame. He has also worked with his sisters-in-law, Charity Sibalo and Shelter Sibanda with the former being Luyanda’s mother. — @mthabisi_mthire.
