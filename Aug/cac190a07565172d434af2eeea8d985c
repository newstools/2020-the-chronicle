Sibande, an actor from the Madlela Series, this week shared pictures purportedly tying the knot and got some of his fans congratulating him. Regrettably, the actor, real name Noble Charlie Nxumalo, has come out saying the pictures were from a scene from an upcoming skit to raise awareness about gender based violence. One of the pictures which had Sibande’s partner in crime Madlela Skhobokhobo in it, was convincing that a wedding had/was about to happen as Madlela was gazing at what seemed like Sibande’s partner and impatiently waiting for them to kiss. It was shared on Madlela’s Facebook page. After seeing the image, fans congratulated Sibande with some questioning whether the ceremony indeed happened considering that the two characters are comics. Commenting on this, Sibande said he was grateful for the hearty gratitudes from fans and shared that the pictures were in fact, scenes from a skit. “Well, this particular skit hasn’t been approved yet, but we’ve been raising awareness on domestic violence with Madlela using skits,” said Sibande. World over, because of the Covid-19 induced lockdown, there has been an increase in domestic violence cases. Zimbabwe is no exception as victims have been forced to stay at home with their tormentors. Seeing this, Sibande said this was their way of educating fans about the dangers of GBV. “We’re trying to send a message out there that people mustn’t take out their frustrations on each other in homes. We’re trying to tell people to have tolerance with each other at home,” said Sibande. He said the interest that the picture has generated is good as it has served as a good teaser ahead of the skit. He urged their followers to watch out for the skit. Artistes from Zimbabwe have been challenged to come up with innovative ways in which to disseminate information about Covid-19. Some artistes have heeded the call with songs, plays and skits.
