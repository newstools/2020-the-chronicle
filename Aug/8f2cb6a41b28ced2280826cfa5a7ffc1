EX-HIGHLANDERS and national team winger Joel Luphahla excluded himself from his Bosso best 11, naming three stars that he played with when Bosso won three championships on the trot at the turn of the millennium. Luphahla, who also had a four-year stint in Cyprus before moving to South Africa, named United States of America-based ex-Bosso and national team captain Thulani ‘Biya’ Ncube, former Soccer Star of the Year Zenzo Moyo and Johannes Ngodzo in his choice of Highlanders’ greatest 11 of all time. It is unusual for a celebrated footballer to leave himself out when naming his greatest 11, especially for a team that he helped win glory, but Luphahla’s choice shows that he appreciates that there are greater people who donned the Bosso black and white stripes. <img class="wp-image-484381 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Joel-Luphahla-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Joel-Luphahla.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Joel-Luphahla-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joel Luphahla “It’s very difficult to come up with a best 11 because Bosso in Zimbabwe is the best team in terms of producing players generation after generation. That team is like a machine; it becomes difficult to come up with the best 11, as some might not be good for other people, but it’s my choice. Some other people might have their best 11 that is different from mine, but I’ve come up with players that I watched play for Highlanders,” said Luphahla in an interview with Zim Soccernet. Below, is Luphahla’s best Highlanders 11: Goalkeeper: Peter “Oxo” Nkomo
“I watched him a lot. He’s a legend. I would have gone with Tapiwa Kapini, he’s one of the best players to come from Highlanders and the national team. I played with him at Afcon in 2004 and 2006. My choice is Peter Nkomo because of his leadership qualities from the back. I understand there are a lot of stories about him, especially from the legends. They say when you didn’t obey him he would punch you.” Defenders
“The back four, my right-back of choice is Mercedes ‘Rambo’ Sibanda. No right-back can come close to him. Maybe Noel Kaseke might come close, but Rambo was a force to reckon with in Zimbabwean football. “For left-back, I’ll go with Dumisani Nyoni. The man had a very swift left foot. You could see that his son Vusa Nyoni took after his dad. “The centre-backs, I will go with Alexander Maseko. I watched him, he was very cool, that’s why they called him Cool Ruler. The other centre back is my captain Thulani Biya. I know most Highlanders fans will agree with me. At one stage he captained us at Bosso, the Under-23 and the national team. He had great qualities, he was a leader, he led from the front.” Central midfielders
“The two central midfielders I’ll go with are both late, Benjamin Nkonjera and Willard Khumalo. The two were very creative midfielders, good with the ball at their feet and very charismatic footballers. “I know there are lot of players I’m leaving out. There’s ‘British’ Douglas Mloyi, I didn’t watch him. I think by that time I was still in Tsholotsho when he played. I’ve also left out Makheyi Nyathi. And I’ll stick with Mackanaky and Mashinkila.” Attacking trio
“Three players in front of the central midfielders on the left side it has to be the great Peter Ndlovu. He was an inspirational captain. I was lucky to play with him at the Nations Cup. You could see the class he had. <img class="wp-image-502407 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Peter-Ndlovu-1-680x382.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Peter-Ndlovu-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Peter-Ndlovu-1-360x202.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Peter Ndlovu “On the right side, my choice is the late Adam Ndlovu. I could have gone with his brother Madinda, whom I watched, but Adam stands out for me. Adam was Mr Goals. In the national team we complemented each other well with Adam. “Behind the top striker, I know I’m a little bit biased, but I think one of the most gifted footballers Johannes Ngodzo. That boy was just marvelous. Excuse me for saying that boy, because when Ngodzo broke into first team to play with us, he used to polish our boots. He was very young and in camp we would send him to do some chores. The things he did with the ball were marvelous. He was unlucky not to go outside the country because of injury. When he had the ball at his feet, we used to hide because he was a dangerous passer of the ball. “I know there are better players I didn’t watch and some I saw who could play where I’ve selected Ngodzo. I could have gone with my mentor Rahman Gumbo, but I can’t leave out Signature, as Ngodzo was known in my team.” Lone striker
“Top striker is the man I played with for four years in Cyprus, my brother ‘Zemura’ Zenzo Moyo. When the chips were down you could look up to him. He had a heart of a warrior, this character that would drive you and he’ll stand tall and get goals from nowhere. He didn’t have that thing (skill) which other strikers had, but as a coach you wanted a player who could get you 10 or 15 goals and Zenzo is the one.” — @ZililoR
