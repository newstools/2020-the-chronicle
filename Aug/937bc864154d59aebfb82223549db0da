THREE Victoria Falls men who broke into 10 houses and stole more than 50 broiler chickens and five empty 200 litre drums have been arrested. Jabulani Tshuma (21), Prosper Ngwenya (27) both of Mkhosana suburb and Dumisani Mathe (18) of Chinotimba committed the crimes at night from May until last week. The trio broke into premises and stole chickens from fowl runs. The three pleaded guilty to 10 counts of criminal trespass, five of stocktheft and another five of theft when they appeared before Victoria Falls magistrate Ms Linda Dzvene yesterday. They told the court that they intended to steal. “We entered the houses with the intention to steal, and we ate the chickens,” said Tshuma with his accomplices agreeing. The magistrate remanded them in custody to Monday for sentencing. Prosecuting Mr Bheki Tshabalala said Tshuma, Ngwenya and Mathe stole a total of 53 chickens valued at $21 400 from five houses and five empty drums worth $3 800 from five other houses. “On the 1st day of August and at council pool houses in Chinotimba the three accused persons entered the complainant’s yard without permission. “While inside the yard the accused persons stole 15 broiler chickens belonging to Mr Bernard Tshuma employed as a clerk at the municipality and went away. They sold two chickens to Ms Princess Sebele in Mkhosana and ate the rest,” said Mr Tshabalala in respect on one of the counts. The three were arrested following investigations by police. Police managed to recover only all the five drums they had stolen. — @ncubeleon
