A BLOOD bath marked the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) first day of trading following a month long suspension with investors losing a cumulative $10 billion. Total market value closed yesterday with trade at $218 billion from the $228 billion recorded on June 26, 2020. Stocks had last traded on 26 June 2020, after Government suspended trading activity on the local bourse on allegations of economic sabotage by some players. Trading, however, resumed yesterday, but financial services giant — Old Mutual, regional cement maker — PPC and SeedCo International remain suspended. The three, which are also listed on other exchanges are alleged to have been used as means of siphoning foreign currency out of the country with investors “abusing” their fungibility.
