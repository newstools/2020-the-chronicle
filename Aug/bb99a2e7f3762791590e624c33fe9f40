LUPANE State University has donated half a tonne of mealie meal to Matabeleland North provincial Covid-19 quarantine centres as part of efforts to help stop the spread of the disease which has killed 84 Zimbabweans. There are about 11 quarantine centres in the province that house returnees. As of yesterday, there were 4 339 Covid-19 infections in Zimbabwe and 1 264 have recovered since the outbreak of the disease on March 20. Matabeleland North Province has the least confirmed cases after Mashonaland Central Province (44) with 73 and two deaths. According to the Ministry of Health and Child Care, of the 73 cases, 33 people have recovered. A majority of the confirmed cases were recorded from returnees who account for 44 of the total Covid-19 cases in Matabeleland North. The donation is a follow up on earlier donations by LSU to fight the pandemic. Speaking before handing over the maize meal to Lupane district coordinator Mrs Ennety Sithole yesterday, LSU director of marketing and public relations Mr Zwelithini Dhlamini said the institution would continue supporting every initiative to stop the spread of the global pandemic. “The Lupane State University is donating half a tonne of mealie meal to Matabeleland North Province, which will help feed the needy in quarantine centres around the province. Our university is part and parcel of the greater community and will always continue to render all support possible to such humanitarian situations with resources permitting,” said Mr Dlamini. “This is the third donation this year towards the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic as previously we have donated 300kgs of mealie meal, and 1 000 litres of hand sanitiser to various schools in our province.” He said that the donations will be distributed from the provincial coordinator’s office. @thamamoe
