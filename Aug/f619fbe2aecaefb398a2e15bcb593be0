The Chronicle ASTON Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba could be on his way after just a year at the club. Nakamba arrived at Villa Park for €12 million from Club Brugge last summer, going on to make 29 appearances in the Premier League this season, starting 19 times. But he could be on his way already, according to Fotomac, who claim there is interest from Turkey. They claim Trabzonspor want to sign Nakamba on loan this summer. Nakamba has shown potential this season but has struggled with inconsistency, like many of his teammates in what was a difficult season for Villa, despite managing to avoid the drop. Recent reports have suggested he is happy in England, having no intention of leaving Villa this summer. Despite that, it seems Trabzonspor will look to offer him a route away from Villa Park on a temporary basis. The Turkish giants finished second in the Turkish SuperLig this season, though they are barred from European competition due to Financial Fair Play breaches. Nevertheless, they could prove to be an attractive proposition to Nakamba should Villa look to offload him ahead of next season. The report claims Trabzonspor are looking to sign the 26-year-old midfielder as they look to mount an improved title bid after falling four points short this season. Nakamba, though, is under contract at Villa until 2024 and it seems he is trusted by Dean Smith having played 34 times in all competitions. – Birmingham mail.
