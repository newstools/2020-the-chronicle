Up-and-coming rapper, Etrax (real name Elias Chagwedera) is set to drop a single titled Bonnie on Saturday. The single is off his upcoming album titled Better Days which is due for release before year end. Influenced by the likes of Nas, Rick Ross, Teargas, Sani Makhalima and Major Players, the artiste’s musical career dates back to 2010 when he first set foot in studio to record with rap crew, Kul Geez. Nkulumane’s Etrax who founded Ziyawa dance group said the new single is meant to tease fans ahead of his forthcoming album which will have nine songs. In the song Bonnie, Etrax sings about a single top lady who intimidates guys because of her beauty. Etrax seems to be up for the challenge as he promises to treat Bonnie right if she accepts him. On his forthcoming mixtape, he said it will have songs that include Ziyawa Namhlanje, a track which was the most played on Skyz Metro FM some years back. “Other songs on the album are Dear Mama, Dladleni, Neva give up, Lyf is a wheel, Umthandazo ka lova, Vumani la and a freestyle titled Kasi rap,” he said. The album, Etrax said, is set to feature his siblings BmB (real name Blessing Chagwedera) and Kaydee (real name Kudakwashe Chagwedera) among other artistes. “The album will feature big names as I’m looking forward to working with Sandra Ndebele, Cal Vin, Asaph and Vic Jita.” – @mthabisi_mthire.
