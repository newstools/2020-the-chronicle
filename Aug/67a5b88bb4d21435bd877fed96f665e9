Versatile RnB/Soul artiste, Mimmie Tarukwana (real name Mubanga Tarukwana) wants to impart her skills and empower other musicians by offering them vocal lessons online to improve their singing skills. The lessons which are running under the Vocal Classes for Beginners with Mimmie banner are being conducted through online chat platforms, Zoom and WhatsApp. Commenting on the lessons, Mimmie said: “Vocal Classes for Beginners with Mimmie is a small step to my bigger goal, of empowering aspiring vocalists and musicians. “It’s an online class where I’ll be tutoring those that want to learn how to sing and strengthen their vocal ability, through basic vocal training. “The lessons comprise six courses which have been simplified for everyone to understand the basics of singing.” The former Outfit Band member who went solo two years ago said when the lockdown restrictions are eased, she hopes to conduct one on one sessions with up-and-coming artistes. “Hopefully, after the lockdown, I’ll be able to get my own space and start tutoring people one on one, physically,” she said. A beneficiary of Nigerian singer, Mr Eazi’s emPawa project where she recorded a single and video last year, the 26-year-old artiste is coming up well as a solo musician. She started singing in 2013 and was a backing vocalist for various artistes from Bulawayo including Lorraine Maplanka-Stot and Takesure Zamar Ncube before joining the Outfit Band in 2015. In 2018, she went solo and released her debut single Khetha. Currently, she has five singles which include Selfish, Freedom, Happiness and Spread the love. – @mthabisi_mthire.
