Sibanda (47) of Siabuwa Village under Chief Sialutenga area appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya yesterday facing charges of inciting public violence. He was remanded out of custody to September 17.

The masks were inscribed with boldly written words #ZANU-PF MUST GO. “On August 2, 2020 and at TM Pick n Pay Hyper Supermarket, the accused person gave two face masks to Mr Marvelous Ndaba and Mr Brian Maunze.
