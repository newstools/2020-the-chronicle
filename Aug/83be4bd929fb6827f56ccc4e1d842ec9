The Chronicle Yoliswa Dube-Moyo I’VE had a miserable winter experience this year; you’ve no idea just how much I’ve been looking forward to summer! Because Khaya has had to be wearing multiple pieces of clothing, I’ve had tonnes of laundry at the end of each week. Bulawayo’s water woes have made laundry days all the more difficult for me. There’s just been no rest and quite frankly, I’ve had enough! I’m just glad we can finally wear fewer pieces of clothing and I can breeze through laundry days like a normal person. But what’s exciting me the most is the fact that I can finally slip into dresses and sandals. Nothing is more comfortable than a little dress and free feet. Fashion is subjective and everyone has a different idea of what looks good, but there are definitely some summer fashion dos and don’ts. What may seem cute or appropriate might be the actual opposite. Since we feel our best during the summer, it is fun to try to look our best as well. Deep Vs are always a good idea; a blouse or dress with a deep V show off your neckline and also allow you to breathe. A plunging neckline, when done tastefully, is sexy and bold. <img class="alignnone wp-image-506944 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/legs-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/legs-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/legs-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> If you decide to wear a plunging neckline, I recommend a narrow, deep V that doesn’t go beneath the rib cage. Also, to keep the plunging neckline look classy, go for a neutral or dark coloured top rather than a neon or bright top. White is the ultimate summer neutral. It feels so light and airy that you should try styling it head-to-toe once in a while. Don’t do sheer tops with colourful bras. A sheer top is a hot trend but it’s definitely not meant to be paired with a hot pink bra underneath. If you are going to wear a sheer blouse, wear it with a bra that’s a solid, neutral colour. Colourful or patterned bras can make your outfit look juvenile. Navy is the ultimate neutral colour in my opinion. It’s not too boring, bland, or basic in comparison to other neutrals, plus navy can look feminine and professional as well. The best thing about navy is that it can be worn at work or dinner, making it the perfect day-to-night colour. If you’re looking to take a navy outfit from winter to summer, try pairing it with something white for a nautical look. <img class="alignnone wp-image-506941 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/legs-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/legs-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/legs-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Don’t wear a bra with straps with a string top. That irritates me to the nines. If you’re going to be wearing a string top, have the decency to find a strapless bra to go with it. I can’t emphasise enough the importance of smelling good all the more this summer. When you smell good, you’re automatically more attractive. Body odour can taint a beautifully put together outfit. Make sure your deodorant and fragrance are always on point. Don’t wear flip flops if your feet are unkempt. If you know you’re going to show the whole world your feet, get your nail cutter out and make sure your feet are clean and well moisturised. Leggings are the epitome of comfort, but when the sun’s out, your legs should be too! However, if you’re not comfortable showing off your legs or are too lazy to shave them, maxi skirts and dresses are always a great idea. They cover the entirety of your legs and they’re ultra-comfortable. If it’s a little windy, you can pair them with a denim jacket. Maxi skirts with slits are easy to move around in if you’re on the go.
Remember to always buy clothes that fit. Be realistic with yourself whenever you go shopping for clothes. You won’t lose weight to fit into that smaller size. Buy clothes that fit now. Well-fitting clothes always make you look more stylish. Don’t wear sky rocket heels you can’t walk in. That is so unattractive! There are no laws forcing people to wear six inch heels. Wear shoes you can manage. We wouldn’t want you spraining an ankle. Drink plenty of water, moisturise your lips and always keep a breath mint!
