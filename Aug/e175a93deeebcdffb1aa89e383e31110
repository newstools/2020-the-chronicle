ZIMBABWEAN songstress, Nkwali who is a victim of abuse has decided to share her story through a single Uyimbokodo, with the music video due to be released this Friday. The single is from her upcoming album titled Themba which was named after her late father and is dedicated to him. Musician Dumisani “Ramadu” Moyo produced and recorded the song whose lyrics were composed by Nkwali. Without getting into detail, Nkwali said she was abused like the many women in this world, a story she will share through the Uyimbokodo. She said the music video will be premiered on her YouTube channel and Facebook page on Friday. “I went through all those kinds of abuses and I know how it feels to be a victim of abuse. I got the inspiration (of Uyimbokodo) from my own experience and of course, from what we see and read about everyday. “I know there are men who go through abuse and I think it’s really bad. People should talk things through and not fight,” said Nkwali who is currently in the country because of the lockdown. Uyimbokodo, Nkwali said talks about women abuse as well as child abuse. “Women go through so much abuse emotionally, verbally, physically and sexually. If a mother is abused, it affects her kids as well. Children watch their fathers beat up their mothers and that is the worst thing any child can go through. Women are raped, killed or sometimes left for dead, issues I tackle on the song,” she said. Nkwali urged men who abuse women not to do so as they would not abuse their own mothers. “With this song, I’m basically saying let’s love, respect and protect our women because they make us who we are,” she said. – @bonganinkunzi
