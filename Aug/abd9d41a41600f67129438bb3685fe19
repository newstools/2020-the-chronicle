SOFT drink manufacturer, Varun Beverages Zimbabwe, has launched a new energy drink product line called “Sting” as it seeks to enhance consumer choice and taste. The latest offering will be available on the market in 440 millimetres, said the company in an update. “Vanrun Beverages Zimbabwe lauched an energy drink variant from PepsiCo portfolio, Sting. “Our new ‘can line’ investment will see the Sting Energy Drink sold in 440ml cans,” said the manufacturing firm. The company also announced that it would commence the sale of preform (moulded, precast shaped containers used for bottles) packaging to other beverage manufacturers as one of the product of the new Husky line investment. Varun Beverages corporate affairs vice president Fungai Murahwa added that this was in line with the company’s policy and business growth strategy. The firm’s policy seeks to integrate the business backwards while moving ahead of the curve with investments that help and create the opportunities for the other businesses, he said. “This also promotes local manufacturing of products, which would otherwise be imported, such as energy drinks and preform packaging,” said Mr Murahwa.
