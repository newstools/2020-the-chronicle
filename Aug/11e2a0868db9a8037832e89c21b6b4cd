CAF’s decision to postpone the Under-20 Women’s World Cup Qualifiers that had been scheduled for next month should come as a relief for Zifa, which was yet to begin any preparations for the assignment. Zimbabwe were set to play Ethiopia in the second-round of qualifiers in two weeks’ time. Zifa announced the postponement on its website. With the country yet to begin any football activities, it was set to be a tall order hosting the Ethiopians. “Our Under-20 women’s team’s match against Ethiopia this September has been postponed indefinitely. “Caf rightly says travel restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 are still in place in most countries,” read the Zifa post. Caf’s decision to postpone the games was nessecitated by the travel restriction situation in African countries. Caf had scheduled the first-round in September before the second and third rounds in October and November. The first-round first-leg was set for September 3-5, with the return leg from September 10-12, 2020. The revised fixtures for the qualifiers will be announced in due course after consultation with various stakeholders. Two teams will qualify to represent Africa in the final tournament from January to February 6, 2021, in Costa Rica and Panama.
