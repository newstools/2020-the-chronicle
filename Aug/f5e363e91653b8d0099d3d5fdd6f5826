Season Two of Zimbabwean television talk show, Pink & Purple is set to premiere next month on the ONVI TV YouTube Channel with a new host, Thembie Phiedarh. The show will feature episodes with Berita, MisRed and Sarah Nyathi. Pink & Purple talk show is a television programme that was created two years ago to promote women’s participation in the media space. The last season featured Lady Tshawe, former Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Samantha Tshuma and Sizwakele “Zwa” Ndlovu among others. The first season which was hosted by Princess Mpofu, has repeatedly played on national television (ZBCtv) since 2018 to-date. In a statement, Onvi TV Productions said the second season will feature a number of amazing female guests from different industries and social backgrounds across Zimbabwe and Canada. “The second season will be shown on September 1. Some of the guests include Stella Nkomo (ZITF), Rev. Sarah Nyathi (HHI Church), Medjy Mezilous (Canada), MisRed and Berita Khumalo among many other guests. “Various topics will be covered within the show’s 30 episodes, ranging from business, health, entertainment, celebrity profiles, lifestyle, and many social topics,” read the statement. Releasing the show online is part of the production house’s efforts to increase their reach. “The decision to release this season of the show online came as part of the team’s plan to extend the viewership of the show beyond borders and to those without access to local television.” To watch the talk show, people need to subscribe to the Onvi TV YouTube channel. Many creatives around the world are now taking advantage of online platforms such as YouTube to get their content to people. Most shows such as Wadiwa Wepa Moyo that have been aired on that platform have been warmly received and kept people glued to their smart devices.
