Currently, Bhaker Golide has 11 employees and is on a mission to dress a number of internationally acclaimed artistes.

Among those who have donned Fresh Map apparel are maskandi sensation – South Africa-based Zinjaziyaluma, Khuzani Ndlovu and DJ Unity. Recently, Bhaker Golide designed Madlela Skhobokhobo’s trendy overalls which the axe-wielding artiste hopes to take up as his official stage regalia. Speaking from his base in Johannesburg, Bhaker Golide said: “It’s not been easy beingin an industry which you had not planned to be part of. However, I can proudly say FreshMap is a brand that I was given by God when things were very bad for me. “In 2017, I made a jacket for Madlela as I wanted influential people to don my brand. In 2018, I promoted the business using my car as a store. Since then, I’ve travelled to Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi selling my clothes. “In SA, I’d go for BMW spin shows and Freshmap clothes would sell like hot cakes as people loved the style,” said Bhaker Golide. He said working with Madlela Skhobokhobo is part of efforts to popularise the Fresh Map brand in Zimbabwe where he is eyeing to setup a store as well as Botswana. – @mthabisi_mthire
