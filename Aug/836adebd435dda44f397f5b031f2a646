A Highlanders player could become the second Zimbabwean to ply his trade in Sudan if an official offer is made and accepted by Bosso. Top Sudanese side Al Hilal are reportedly “drafting a lucrative deal for both the player and Bosso”, although no official contact has yet been made. Should a deal be reached, the player would become the second Zimbabwean after Edward Sadomba to ply his trade in the Sudanese League and coincidentally for the same club. Sadomba illuminated the Sudanese league and is still idolised by its passionate fans. When FC Platinum played against Al Hilal in the Caf Champions League late last year, there was a stand with a huge Sadomba banner in the home team’s stadium. “We will remain guided by the player’s current club Highlanders because our interest here is on the clause we signed with Highlanders that we will get 30 percent of the transfer fees if the player gets a deal outside the country,” said his handlers. Contacted for comment yesterday, the player confirmed that he’d heard rumours of interest for his services, but was still in the dark concerning any details. “To be honest no one has told me clearly about this potential move, but yes, I have heard about it,” said the player. With just four months left on his contract, he could become the second Highlanders’ player to leave, following Prince Dube’s imminent move to Tanzanian outfit Azam. Al Hilal, who have a strong rivalry with Al Merriek, have a record 28 league titles and are on course to lift their 29th league championship medal, as they are currently leading the pack in the Sudani Premier League, with Al Merriek breathing heavily down their neck. The two are separated by just three points after 22 matches, with Al Hilal on 51 points and 10 matches to go. Al Hilal are owned by one of the richest business tycoons in Sudan and have their own 65 000-seater stadium, newspaper and television station.
