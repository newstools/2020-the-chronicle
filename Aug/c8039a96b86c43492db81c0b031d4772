Devastating finishing, coupled with pace, trickery and a grafty tactical nous, Eto’o preceded his own reputation. “Goals wherever he went vaulted his teams to Uefa Champions League glory on three occasions, with Eto’o scoring in two finals. A marksman on the pitch and an arrow for humanitarian causes off it, Eto’o was more than just a striker. He was a creator, facilitator and leader. A legend, in the truest sense.” He joins other African stars such as Didier Drogba, Michal Essien and Jay-jay Okocha.
