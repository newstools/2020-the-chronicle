THE Bulawayo Table Tennis Association (BTTA) will conclude its virtual Level 1 three-day coaching course today. The course started on Wednesday with an enrolment of more than 200 coaches from around the country. BTTA chairperson Bibiana Ncube said the course is meant to help equip coaches with the requisite skills to promote the sport in the country. “This is a national coaching Level 1 course being facilitated by our national president Noah Fernando and national technical director Nelson Madzoreke. We believe this course, which is free, is going to empower our coaches. All that is required from participants is connectivity and the end of the course they will
get certificates,” said Ncube. She said the course comes at a time when Bulawayo province is in the process of reviving table tennis by urging schools and tertiary institutions to introduce table tennis in their extracurricular activities to help develop the game in Zimbabwe. Table tennis is among sports that have been given the go ahead to resume activities under strict health and safety measures in accordance with the country’s Covid-19 regulatons. Ncube said they are in the process of organising an amateur tournament in the next few weeks if given the green light. — @innocentskizoe
