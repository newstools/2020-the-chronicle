A 41-YEAR-OLD Hwange man has been arrested after he was allegedly caught red-handed cutting TelOne fibre optic cables about 10km outside the coal mining town. Matabeleland North police spokesperson Chief Inspector Siphiwe Makonese confirmed the arrest of Garrison Mwembe of Lwendulu Village. She said Mwembe first cut down some gum poles balancing the overhead fibre optic cables before cutting 330 metres of the line. “I can confirm that police have arrested a man who was caught by TelOne employees cutting fibre optic cables,” she said. Chief Insp Makonese said investigations are still in progress and Mwembe was expected to appear in court soon. TelOne technicians allegedly caught Mwembe on Thursday last week as they started duty in the morning. “On 13 August at 8am the informant and his workmates commenced duty and started patrolling between GVZ and 5 Miles. They saw the accused cutting overhead optic fibre cables and approached the scene to investigate more,” added Chief Insp Makonese. She said upon seeing the technicians, Mwembe fled. The TelOne technicians gave chase and caught Mwembe before dragging him back to the scene. The technicians recovered 330 metres of overhead optic fibre which Mwembe had already cut. They also recovered a bag containing a hacksaw, shifting spanners and knife which he used in commission of the offence. Mwembe allegedly used a hacksaw to cut down gun poles so as to access the overhead cables. The TelOne technicians handed over Mwembe to the police leading to his arrest. The value of the damaged property is yet to be ascertained as investigations are still continuing.-@ncubeleon
