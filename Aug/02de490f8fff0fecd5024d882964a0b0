TALENTED musician Mdu Sevan has shown that through commitment, nothing is impossible after his experimental track, Happy Death Day got 5 000 downloads within 24 hours. The deep house track which he produced and mastered in two hours during the wee hours of July 31 was released the following day at midday. To the musician’s surprise, the song seems to be a hit as it has gotten over 10 000 downloads in six days on Data File Host, a website that allows users to upload and download videos, images and audios. Happy Death Day, a very creepy song which provokes imagination through audio frequencies, has soulful and bits of horrific cinematic sounds. Quizzed about the song’s inspiration, MduSevan who is riding high with his hit house/gqom song Uyangithanda said he wanted to prove to fellow musicians that contrary to popular belief that locals do not support their own music, they do, one must just give them what they want. “We had an argument before where people were saying some don’t support local music so I thought to myself, why not run an experiment? “I’ve always maintained that the issue is not about being mainstream, but on how you market your works and focus on the niche market. “I still maintain that in Bulawayo, people love our music but they just aren’t given the chance to grow,” said Mdu Sevan. – @mthabisi_mthire.
