Masilela, a Rhythm City actor was shot during an attempted hijacking. “It has been a difficult journey and I feel it’s time to let go, holding on what hurts more. Losing Dumi two months after our wedding was worse than my worst nightmare and after he passed away, I was afraid that people would forget him. So I did everything I could to keep his memory alive. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-507387" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/9560794A-A082-46E1-A53E-E5CD01079F27.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/9560794A-A082-46E1-A53E-E5CD01079F27.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/9560794A-A082-46E1-A53E-E5CD01079F27-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
“But, at some point, I realised that holding on hurts so much more. It felt like I had a memorial service every time I did something to keep his memory alive and I went through all the emotions all over again,” she said in a statement to TshisaLIVE last year. Also sharing the news of the pregnancy through posts on his social media pages, South Africa-based Tinotenda “Tino” Chinyani who often leaves ladies mesmerised by his looks and body wrote: “Lord knows how long I prayed on this moment and to be answered in the most beautiful way possible. I thank the Lord up above that you blessed me with your presence and showed me who I could truly be and for that I’ll forever be grateful. The 24-year-old model and TV presenter went on to vow to Ngema that he will always love and cherish her. “For this gift you have given me, I promise I will always love, care and be there for you and our seed. May our seed grow to be a leader of change, a leader of hope and serve the Lord in all their ways. My legacy continued, my mini me,” posted Chinyani.
