The Chronicle ARGENTINA President Alberto Fernandez has urged Lionel Messi to return to his homeland after he handed in a transfer request to leave Barcelona. Lionel Messi is still pushing his way out of the place he’s called home for the past 19 years. Since handing in his formal transfer request on August 25, Messi has since refused to show up for his mandatory medical check with Barcelona and has told Barcelona executives that he hopes he doesn’t have to resort to filing a lawsuit to leave. However, due to his desire to leave, many clubs have been asking about the Argentine, including his first-ever club Newell’s Old Boys. The Rosario-based team in Argentina was Messi’s first club and he spent seven years there between 1993 to 2000 before moving to Barcelona to join the famous La Masia academy. The Argentina president has weighed in on the situation and is currently trying to urge Messi to come home and re-join Newell’s Old Boys. “You are in our hearts and we have never seen you play in our country…Give us the pleasure of ending your career with Newell’s Old Boys, your club.” Newell’s club vice-president Cristian D’Amico also told the Argentinian TV channel: “Maradona came and everyone believed it was impossible. What Newell’s fan doesn’t have the dream to see the greatest in our shirt?” – Sport Bible
