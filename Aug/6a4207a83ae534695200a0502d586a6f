THE Community Action to Achieve Prosperity (CAAP) Trust has donated 20 hands-free hand washing machines to help pupils from Nkayi District reduce their risk of contracting Covid-19 which has killed 153 Zimbabweans. According to CAAP, the machines were produced in the district by school dropouts who are engaged in different activities to keep them away from crime and early marriages. Beneficiaries include Guwe Primary and Secondary Schools, Gwitshi Primary School, Duhamzondo Primary School, Zinyangeni Primary Schools and Nkayi Prison. Villagers from Makhalima and police from Nkayi will also get one of the machines to help them practise hand hygiene. CAAP director Mr Mthokozisi Moyo said the organisation had received a grant from the Pollination Project which is based in the United States of America to help communities respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We then made use of an ongoing youth programme in Nkayi and sourced materials for manufacturing hands-free hand washing machines for Ward 21 in Nkayi District which will be given to schools, clinics, Nkayi prison and grinding mills. I am happy to say that the manufacturing of these machines will also benefit our school dropouts in Nkayi who made the machines from scratch,” said Mr Moyo. He said it was important for communities to be empowered with such machines to enable them practise hand hygiene as water was scarce in the community. “With these machines they will be able to wash their hands when schools open and that way their risk to Covid-19 will be reduced. We are also raising awareness within Nkayi District so that villagers know more about the disease and how they can practice social distancing and wear masks to prevent infection,” added Mr Moyo. — @thamamoe
