The Chronicle Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba is a loan target for Turkish club Trabzonspor. The Zimbabwean had a mixed first year in the Premier League, making 23 starts as his club avoided relegation on the final day of the season, but he still has admirers across the continent. Trabzonspor have also looked at Villa winger Trezeguet as they look to make an assault on European football after finishing second in the Super Lig in 2019-20, and they believe Nakamba (26) would fit their midfield requirements. Villa paid Club Brugge about £11 million for Nakamba as part of the £140 million they spent on transfer after promotion from the Championship, and it is unlikely Trabzonspor would offer a similar amount. It is thought, instead, that they would be keen on an initial loan deal. Villa manager Dean Smith is keen to prioritise players with Premier League experience as Villa look to have a more comfortable campaign in 2020-21. The club’s billionaire owner Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens are understood to be prepared to spend again to push Villa closer to the top six, with a centre-forward, a wide attacker and a central midfielder high on the club’s list of targets. – Daily Mail
