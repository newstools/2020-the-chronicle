HIGHLANDERS’ coach Mark Harrison seems to have accepted the departure of his marksman Prince Dube, who is set to reunite with former teammate Bruce Kangwa at ambitious Tanzanian side Azam. Speaking from his base in the United Kingdom, Harrison told Chronicle Sport that it was always inevitable the player would eventually be sold. Dube’s departure from Bosso was expedited on Friday. Intermediary Gibson Mahachi, who represents Dube, drove to Bulawayo on Friday and held meetings, first with Prince and his uncle Mkhokheli Dube and then later Highlanders where an agreement was reached with only a few loose ends left to be ironed out. <img class="wp-image-468671 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/prince-dube-4-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/prince-dube-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/prince-dube-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Prince Dube It is believed Bosso want a clause inserted that will see the club getting a certain percentage in the event that Azam sell the player to another club. “Look, it’s a situation that was always waiting to happen. It was inevitable he would be sold eventually. It’s great for Prince and I wish him all the very best in his new endeavour. “It’s also an excellent move as the income generated will help support the club during these uncertain times and for me as a coach it’s something as a professional you have to deal with,” said Harrison. He said while the gap was likely to be felt, Highlanders had many players that were equally capable of filling the void created by Prince’s departure. “We have an excellent squad of players waiting to step in and fill the space left by Prince. At the moment it’s too early to be thinking about finding an outside replacement, we will have to assess when we get back to training,” Harrison said.
