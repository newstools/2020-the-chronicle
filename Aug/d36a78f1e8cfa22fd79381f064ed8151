I joined the local choir and quickly assimilated with a music group called Pentecostal Fire. We successfully recorded two albums, Impilo Yami and Akwenzeki. “With the same band, we went on to host three successive shows. From then, I tried to go solo which resulted in me recording Prophecy, Back to God and Confounding. “Around 2014, I auditioned with a choir called Cross Motion which went on to record my song titled Holy which up to today, is getting positive airplay on radio. After the choir disbanded, I had a journey with Gospel maniacs which was unsuccessful. I then decided to go fully solo. From this point I ventured into the secular scene with a genre called Rock. I managed to record Dead on the floor and Shaking the head. Since then I have been growing and growing,” said the enthusiastic artiste. HiRev Rockstar said he chose the rock genre because he grew up listening to the Newsboys, Delirious, Bryan Adams, BonJovi and Third Day among others, something that has seen him lay an apocalyptic style rock. The musician has singles Spoko, Beans, Dead on the floor, Crown, Enemix, Shaking the head, Sfuni Mali and Salt and vinegar.  @mthabisi_mthire
