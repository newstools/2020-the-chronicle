Zimbabwean artistes have been robbed of a selfless man, Roger Muzawazi who was one of the first businessmen to promote local musicians in neighbouring South Africa. Muzawazi, a music promoter who owned Ekurhuleni Boksburg Hotel on the outskirts of Johannesburg, succumbed to diabetes earlier this week. A music lover, Muzawazi helped shape the music industry in Zimbabwe as he hosted the likes of the late Oliver Mtukudzi, Ndolwane Super Sounds, Thomas Mapfumo, Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah, Selmor Mtukudzi, Nox, Freeman and Sulumani Chimbetu among many others at his hotel thereby exposing them to audiences in the neighbouring country. Musicians and promoters described the passing on of Muzawazi as a huge loss for the arts fraternity. Various social media platforms have been awash with condolence messages since Wednesday when the news of his death broke and many have described him as an unsung hero in the music circles. They said he was always ready to assist Zimbabwean artistes visiting the neighbouring country. South Africa-based Martin Sibanda who is the leader of Ndolwane Super Sounds said he had on many occasions rubbed shoulders with the late Muzawazi. <img class="wp-image-507691 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Roger-Muzawazi-and-posters-of-events-he-promoted-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Roger-Muzawazi-and-posters-of-events-he-promoted-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Roger-Muzawazi-and-posters-of-events-he-promoted-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Roger Muzawazi and posters of events he promoted “I’m pained by his sudden death. He was a good man with big dreams for up-and-coming and seasoned musicians. He was a very understanding man. I remember talking to him after my performance where I shared the stage with Slizer, a show he promoted. He personally came on stage and invited me to his hotel in Boksburg to be a guest of honour at Alick Macheso’s show. “Roger was a good man, very generous and with a vision of uplifting his countrymen in a foreign land. He provided up-and-coming artistes with a platform to showcase their talents at his place. I’m short of words. We’ve lost a giant in music industry. MHSRIP,” said Sibanda. Polite “PK” Nkomo, a fellow South Africa-based music promoter who was Muzawazi’s friend, said the loss is not only for his family and friends but for every Zimbabwean artiste. “Its not only the Muzawazi family that has lost but the whole music industry in Zimbabwe. He had a big heart and always ready to assist fellow Zimbabweans. I met Roger in 2015 and he was probably the first guy to bring Zimbabwean artistes to South Africa for live shows. “He introduced me to Macheso after one guy conned me and took my money pretending that he worked with Mberikwazvo (Macheso’s band). That’s how I started promoting Macheso at his hotel in Ekurhuleni. In 2016, we collaborated for a competition for up-and-coming musicians at his hotel. We had about 20 Sungura bands and it was very successful,” said PK. He said Muzawazi was a game changer in terms of promoting Zimbabwean musicians in South Africa and he benefited from his experience. “I learnt a lot from him in terms of music promotion as I followed in his footsteps. He is the one who led the way when he brought the likes of Baba Sharo, Jah Prayzah, Oliver Mtukudzi and Thomas Mapfumo,” said PK. Alick Macheso said Muzawazi was a joy to work with. <img class="alignnone wp-image-507689 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Roger-Muzawazi-and-posters-of-events-he-promoted-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Roger-Muzawazi-and-posters-of-events-he-promoted-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Roger-Muzawazi-and-posters-of-events-he-promoted-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Mudhara Roger as some would fondly call him, had a way with people. He was a joy to work with. His music promotion was not motivated by self-gain as he was an accomplished businessman. We take this opportunity to salute him for his selfless support to Zimbabwean arts through his Ekurhuleni Boksburg Hotel. Many Zimbabwean artistes had an opportunity to perform for their South African fans and made music inroads across the Limpopo, thanks to his good heart and benevolence. As Orchestra Mberikwazvo, we’ve been robbed. Go well Mudhara Roger,” said Macheso. Guitarist, Tendai Manatsa, husband to musician Selmor Mtukudzi said Muzawazi always opened his doors and secured interview slots for them each time they visited South Africa. “I don’t know any other man that opened up his heart and the doors to his house for us in South Africa like Mr R. When no one believed in us, Mr R was there for us. He made sure that we appeared at his Ekurhuleni Boksburg Hotel every now and then. He made sure that we performed at SABC’s Good Morning Show and appeared on big SA Radio stations when no one cared to consider us,” said Manatsa. He said the first time they performed at Carnival City, their participation was facilitated by Muzawazi. “He is the one who organised the Tuku and Zexie Manatsa Concert in SA when everyone chickened out. He bridged broken relationships for us when everyone else was busy watching their own back. We had a home in SA because of him. He was a big brother and a father to us, God sent. Chokwadi munhu akanaka haararame. Rest in Peace,” wrote Manatsa. Selmor concurred with her husband saying she will forever be indebted to Muzawazi. “You became a father to us when we needed one the most. Stranded in SA, you took us in and from that day we became your children. “I owe my career to you for performances in fancy hotels in SA, interviews on SABCtv, all major radio stations in SA, you took us everywhere . . . all expenses paid by you.” “From buying my children and us plane tickets just to come and visit you, to paying for the hotels we stayed in. The food, the shopping, I will forever be indebted to you. “I have never seen greater love shown to a stranger more than the love you showed us. You deserved all the blessings God gave you,” wrote Selmor. Sulumani Chimbetu also thanked Muzawazi for giving him a platform to perform in South Africa. “Why Mudhara Roger? You gave many of us a platform to showcase at your base — Boksburg Hotel. Tinongoti fambai zvakanaka vanga ramasiya rinodzimba. May your soul Rest In Peace,” wrote Chimbetu on his Facebook wall.
