SOUTH Africa-based Tshibilika artiste Khonzani Sibanda who is the leader of Makhonza Super Sounds has penned a song in remembrance of liberation war icons. Taking a leaf from how music was used to orchestrate the war, Sibanda who is popularly known as President Makhonza in entertainment circles said the single titled Sikhumbula Amaqhawe was released last week and is dedicated to the men and women who took up arms to reclaim their birthright. Speaking from his South Africa base, the artiste said he released the song timely, in the month of August when the country is remembering its fallen heroes and heroines. “This song is about our heroes, the likes of George Silundika, Josiah Tongogara, Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe among many others who in their various capacities, contributed to the liberation of this country. “This song which is already receiving airplay on National FM pays tribute to the heroes for the great job they did in the liberation of the country,” President Makhonza said. He said he was inspired by the likes of the late Solomon Skuza, Marko Sibanda and Simon Chimbetu who proved that music is not only about melodies but a weapon that can be used to achieve good things for the majority through the musical role they played. In order to get the song listened to by as many people, President Makhonza said he is marketing the song in South Africa and Zimbabwe. “My team is busy working on logistics to ensure that the song is well marketed back home and this side. This song is definitely one to listen to as it takes listeners back into time,” President Makhonza said. He added that he is confident that the problems bedevilling the country will soon be a thing of the past as long as Zimbabweans unite for a common goal. “As a people, we are suffering, but we need to trust and support our President as he is going to take things back to normalcy. Zimbabwe will emerge a stronger and united country.”
