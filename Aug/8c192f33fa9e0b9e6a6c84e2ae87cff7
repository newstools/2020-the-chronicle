Fans of the late Dendera maestro, Simon “Chopper” Chimbetu will today be taken down memory lane when his family hosts a commemoration show online in honour of him. The show to be aired on Ngoda TV’s Facebook page at 7PM, will have performances from Orchestra Dendera and the late Chimbetu’s videos will also be played. The show themed “Hatikanganwe kwete” is being held to keep Chopper’s legacy alive, 15 years after his death. There will be live performance from a united Dendera outfit comprising Allan, Sulumani, Tryson, Douglas and Saiwa Chimbetu. The Chimbetus will be supported by Obert Chari, Kurai Makore and Ammi Jamanda to ensure a diverse offering. Fans will this time around follow proceedings from the comfort of their homes as public gatherings remain restricted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Chimbetu family representative, Allan said this year they have been forced to hold the celebrations of the Dendera King founding member online due to the pandemic. “Plans for the commemoration are at an advanced stage. This will be a different event as it’s being held on social media. This is a new phenomenon to us but we’re up to the task. We are going to do what we’re best known for and fans should ensure they don’t miss the show,” said Chimbetu. Known by many stage names such as Mr Viscose, Cellullar Simomo and Mukoma Sam, Chopper died on August 14, 2005 at the age of 50 following injuries sustained in a car accident.
