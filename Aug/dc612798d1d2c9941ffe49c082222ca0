ISRAEL-based musician Prince Phiri is preparing to release his second album titled God is A Champion. The album which will be a follow up to his debut album Shifting Higher, will be available on a number of digital platforms. The title track was released recently as a teaser alongside another single, Makabongwe. Speaking from his Jerusalem base, the artiste who has roots in Bulawayo and Tsakane, South Africa, said the forthcoming album is a testimony of his life. “The upcoming album is my personal testimony of how God has turned my life around after I had given up as nothing was working for me. “I wrote the songs through God’s inspiration and in 2017, I got into the studio and did half the project. I continued working on the album last year and I’m glad to say it’s ready now,” said Phiri. The title track, God is A Champion features Mandisi Eem and Makabongwe features Ntombizwakele. “I really appreciate God, something people will understand as they listen to the songs especially Makabongwe UJesu. “Through the album, I also want to advise people to hold on and not give up on what God wants them to do.” The musician said he hopes to officially launch the album through a show online in the coming months.
