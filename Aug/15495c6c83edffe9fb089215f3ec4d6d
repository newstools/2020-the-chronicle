The Chronicle A US couple who pointed guns at Black Lives Matters protesters say it was their ‘God-given right’ to defend their home as they accused the Democrats of wanting to ‘abolish the suburbs’. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who are both lawyers, were speaking at the Republican National Convention where they urged supporters to vote for Donald Trump. Their video message comes after they were charged with brandishing two guns from their front porch as protesters marched along a private road in St Louis, Missouri, during a demonstration in June. Mr McCloskey falsely accused Joe Biden of inviting unchecked lawlessness into the US, telling Republicans it was unfair he had been charged but the ‘out-of-control mob’ marching past his home had not. He said: ‘It seems as if the Democrats no longer view the government’s job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens. ‘Not a single person in the out-of-control mob you saw at our house was charged with a crime. But you know who was? We were.’ The protesters seen in the video are peaceful, but a police report said a large group of people broke past an iron gate and signs that read ‘No Trespassing’ and ‘Private Road’. Mr and Mrs McCloskey were later charged with unlawful use of a weapon. Mrs McCloskey claimed the Democrats had a ‘radical’ vision for the US, adding: ‘They’re not satisfied with spreading the chaos and the violence into our communities, they want to abolish the suburbs altogether. ‘Make no mistake, no matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America.’ Mr McCloskey said Trump would defend the ‘God-given right’ of Americans to defend their homes. The president has previously called the charges against the couple a ‘disgrace’. However, St Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner said at the time: ‘It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those participating in a non-violent protest.’ Metro.co.uk
