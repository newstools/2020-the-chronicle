Two police officers have each been slapped with a three-month jail sentence after they were convicted of manhandling a lawyer at the Kwekwe Magistrates court. Brighton Bvaure (32) and Jasper Nechitima (33) who are based at Kwekwe Central Police Station assaulted Leon Sheunesu Mapfumo employed by Marufu Misi Law Chambers after he tried to enquire about a complainant he was representing. The cops handcuffed and assaulted Mapfumo before detaining him at Kwekwe Central Police Station accusing him of misconduct and obstructing the course of justice. Gokwe Magistrate Mr Hillary Ndlovu sentenced the duo to three months in prison with an option of paying $2 000 fine when they appeared before him facing assault charges. Prosecuting, Mr Tinashe Wazvaremhaka told the court that on April 25 at around 2pm, Mapfumo approached the accused persons at Kwekwe Magistrates courts and enquired about the charge his client, who had been arrested by the accused persons, was facing. The accused persons referred the complainant to Kwekwe Central Police Station where they had detained Mapfumo’s client. During the conversation, a misunderstanding arose over the treatment of Mapfumo’s client. Bvaure then grabbed the complainant by the belt and tripped him to the ground before he locked his arms around his neck. Nechitima then forcefully handcuffed the complainant’s left arm before he handcuffed the other and detained him at the police station. He was released the following day after the intervention of other lawyers who quizzed why their colleague had been arrested.
