The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma , Showbiz Correspondent A film titled Pazimuti: Nyaya yemangoma which is due to premiere on YouTube next month is set to portray unconditional love. A work from the Gweru arts sector, the film which has 12 episodes was shot at various locations in Gweru and Harare. It was written and produced by Takudzwa “Prodical” Musadza, directed by Capture Graphics and Stars Studios. It features actors Diana Mwenamombe, Abeline Mukanga, Monalisa Chikudo and Simbarashe Gwawawa. Narrating the storyline, Prodical said: “The series is about a blind girl who falls in love with a musician from the ghetto. While showing that disability does not mean inability, the series also seeks to raise awareness of the effects of drug abuse.” “We’ll be premiering the first episode around mid-September definitely.” The production is a collaboration of 054tv Magazine, Capture Graphics, Stars Studios and Middle Media. – @mthabisi_mthire
