MUSICIAN Sandra “Sandy” Ndebele is expected to relive her musical career that dates back to 2003 through an online show set for Friday night. The gig, her first solo performance since the lockdown started, will be streamed live on her social media pages. It is expected to start at 10pm. This event, according to the musician, is part of efforts to increase her brand’s visibility especially at a time that she is preparing to launch her new album, Up the Ladder. “The event will take fans down memory down lane as it’ll be a musical journey from 2003 up to 2020. This show is about showing people where it all started and where we are going,” Sandy said. “The show will start at 10pm in order to accommodate those in the diaspora too who have supported us all these years.” Known for her hit track Mama, Sandy last released an album, Izenzo five years ago. It had a glitzy launch at the Large City Hall and featured the likes of Jeys Marabini, South Africa’s Teddy Bears, Thandy Dhlana and Nash. With Sandy being a certified dance queen, a jovial ambience is expected to grip homes on Friday as the Sandy, Sandy chant which was synonymous to her years back, will definitely be relieved. – @mthabisi_mthire.
