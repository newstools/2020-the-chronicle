AFTER having postponed the launch of his album, Ntikoloshi, several times this year, rhumba/tshibilika musician Madlela Skhobokhobo says he is finally ready to launch it through an online show. The Ngamnanka uSaMamo hit-maker had initially planned to launch the album on April 4 at Phoenix Night Club in Gwanda but was forced to postpone it to August 7 due to Covid-19. The launch could not take place on 7 August because the country is still under national lockdown and such gatherings are still banned. Madlela, with support from Nkayi maskandi musician, Clopas Sikhosana and Bajilla, has finally decided to launch the album online on September 11. “I’ll be launching the album through an online show. Preparations are in progress and Sikhosana and Bajilla are set to warm up the stage for me with their hits,” Madlela said. The album, a follow up to Majazana which he released last year, has a mixture of rhumba, tshibilika, Afro-jazz, house and gospel tunes. The tracks are Ntikoloshi, Karikiriki, Salibonani, Njelele featuring Nkosi, I 50 duuu, Station featuring Iyasa, Emasurbabsin featuring Awa, Hwabaraty and Bajilla, Khumbule Khaya, Impi and Tambai which features Bajilla. – @mthabisi_mthire
