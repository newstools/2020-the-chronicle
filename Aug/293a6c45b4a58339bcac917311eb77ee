LOCAL businessman Simbarashe Kahwaza has adopted Bulawayo City FC juniors and offered to pay their match day expenses when football eventually resumes. Through his company Mighty Fandy Trading, which manufactures, among other things, water pumps, grinding meals, compressors and hammer mills, he will provide refreshments and meet other match day costs at the request of the club for junior teams. City officials have been working to get partners during the Covid-19 lockdown. “I was approached by Bulawayo City for help and as a resident of Bulawayo. I thought their proposal to assist the juniors was sound. If you look at it, we tend to go for senior teams, forgetting that the future lies with the juniors. We’ve agreed as a company that once this Covid-19 issue is over, we will assist the club’s juniors,” said Kahwaza. The municipal club has survived the Covid-19 storm through the benevolence of well-wishers, who include Genstorm Global Supplies and Johane Masowe weChishanu Selbourne Park. City were about to finalise a sponsorship deal with Ingwebu Breweries when the Covid-19 lockdown was enforced in March. City vice-chairman Zenzo Moyo expressed gratitude to Kahwaza and said the club will continue with its hunt for more partners. “For a club to survive, we need partners that will assist. We’re working round the clock to try and get more partners on board so that the burden is lessened. If you look at European clubs or even just across Limpopo (South Africa), most teams have numerous partners taking care of different sets of needs. That is what we want to do and we’re grateful to those that assist the club even when there is no action,” said Moyo. “If you look at this deal with Mighty Fandy Trading, we’re preparing for the restart. We’ve been using this Covid-19 lockdown to make sure that we set up systems and not to be found wanting when action resumes,” he said. – @ZililoR
