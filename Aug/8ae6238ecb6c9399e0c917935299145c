THE trio of Cyril Chigodo, Roy Mwadzura and Vitalis Mapuranga will represent Zimbabwe in an online international tournament and they’re sharpening their skills in the virtual Heroes competition that ends tomorrow. The three are part of 90 players that registered for the Online Heroes tournament in four categories, elite section for highly-rated players, open, ladies and the Under-14s. The competition was organised by the Victoria Falls-based Project Chess Zimbabwe and is sponsored by Crystal Candy, with Zimbabwe Chess Federation providing technical assistance. “The Heroes competition started on August 7 and ends on Tuesday. Crystal Candy has provided $20 000 sponsorship, which will be shared across all categories. As games progress, players accumulate points then the winners will be determined after the final games on Tuesday,” said Kripo Chivhenge, the Matabeleland North chairman. Some notable players participating in the tournament include the women’s section trio of Linda Shaba, Christine Makwena and Kudzanai Charinda, who are all national team players, the Under-20 pair of Farai Hamandishe and Leeroy Mpala, as well as regular the Under-14 duo of Nokulunga Ndlovu and Carol Ndlovu. — @ZililoR
