ZIMBABWE songstress Qeqeshiwe Mntambo says she has a song Kukhona about hope for people with the same track uplifting her after she was robbed two months ago. The song, a collaboration she did with award-winning house producer DJ Skaiva will be released this Friday. It is a mixture of deep house, Afro soul and Afro house. People can watch her perform the song during this month’s Credisi Party organised by Iyasa live on the Iyasa Facebook page this Saturday. The Bulawayo-based Qeqe said the song was to give hope to people who are going through problems. “I’m super excited to be releasing this song which is a collaboration with DJ Skaiva. The song is about hope and encouraging people that something good is coming soon. The problems that people are facing today will soon pass,” said Qeqe. She describes the collaboration as one made in Heaven as she effortlessly worked with DJ Skaiva. “This collaboration is a match made in Heaven. I actually forced DJ Skaiva to do a single and he was not motivated to do so. Like most artistes during this lockdown life has been hard for us as I went through a lot also. When I asked him to do the song, he sent the beat and immediately vibed with the song,” said Qeqe. Asked what she had gone through, Qeqe said her phone and other valuables were pinched during a video shoot two months ago. “We were doing some shoot and someone stole my phone among other things. From that time, I was very low and that’s why I want to release this song now because it’s relevant,” said Qeqe. Qeqe is a Nama award winning actress, vocalist and dancer.
