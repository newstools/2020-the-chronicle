The Chronicle THE world’s largest ovarian tumour weighing 110lbs has been removed from a woman in India. The 52-year-old is lucky to be alive after doctors successfully removed the eight stone mass from inside her – the equivalent of a 15-year-old boy. The woman, who did not wish to be named, had noticed her weight balloon – but was unaware of the giant growth on her ovary. By the time she was able to undergo a three-and-a-half-hour operation to remove it, the tumour had grown to 45 per cent of the woman’s body weight. Dr Arun Prasad, who led the surgery at the private Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi, India, said he was left “shell-shocked” by the tumour. Speaking after the operation on Saturday, Dr Prasad said: “I have not witnessed anything like this ever before during my profession – in over three decades of experience. “We should consider it as a miracle that the woman is recuperating well after being operated on for over 180 minutes.” Before her treatment, the woman had swollen to almost 17 stone. The benign tumour made up almost half of that weight and if left untreated, could have caused her ovary to explode. ‘COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL’ The patient had complained of not being able to walk as her feet swelled. She had also begun to suffer from severe anaemia which saw her haemoglobin drop. The woman had to have a blood transfusion before doctors were able to operate. Another doctor involved in the surgery, Abhishek Tiwari, said: “She is lucky that the organs didn’t fail. Otherwise, such pressure could have proved fatal for the patient.” Meanwhile, Dr Prasad praised his team of surgeons for their “wonderful” job. He said: “I see it as an incredible achievement the way the operation has been done. “There was no room for error. The team put in commendable efforts, to say the least.” The patient is set to be discharged on Sunday, a day after her surgery – in what Dr Prasad branded as a “miracle”. – TheSun
