Nkayi musician, Clopas Sikhosana’s journey to realising his dream of recording his first album, has been documented through a music video for his hit song, Isomiso. The maskandi musician who is now an Internet sensation, shot to fame after a video clip of him performing a song about the dangers of the deadly coronavirus, made its way on social media networks and started trending a few weeks ago. The hilarious clip caught the attention of many people including musician Madlela Skhobokhobo who then embarked on a journey from Bulawayo to Nkayi to search for Sikhosana. He wanted to assist Sikhosana, whom he found deep in Nkayi, to record his music after noticing that he was very talented. The two travelled to Bulawayo where Sikhosana had a taste of fame when he went to various radio stations for interviews and managed to record his six-track debut album that has been released and is now available on digital stores. Other than recording an album, he was also dressed by various boutiques and had photoshoots. <img class="wp-image-498868 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/Sikhosana-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/Sikhosana.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/Sikhosana-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Clopas Sikhosana at home with members of his family To chronicle this life-changing journey, Madlela said they decided to share it through a music video that will be released on YouTube on Friday. “It was very important to record Sikhosana’s music journey so that he can look back and see his humble beginnings,” said Madlela. He said the video for Isomiso will show Sikhosana’s transformation. “People will see the difference between the Sikhosana whom we found in Nkayi and the one who went back from Bulawayo when the music video ends. It was important for us to show how he journeyed to Bulawayo, recorded his debut album and had a makeover as well as the reception he got when he returned to his home,” he said. The video was shot by videographer George Moyo, whom Madlela described as a talented young man who is destined for greater heights. “I’d like to thank a young man by the name of George Moyo, a videographer who approached me saying he wanted to help document Sikhosana’s journey through a video. I agreed so we went together to Nkayi and he documented the journey well. He’s a talented young man who’s definitely going to go far,” said Madlela. Once the video is uploaded, Madlela said they would share the YouTube link on Sikhosana’s Facebook page.
