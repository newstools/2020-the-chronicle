Up-and-coming gospel musician Sis Ntoe (real name Ntombizwakele Siwela-Mpofu) is working on a single titled Teach me to trust you. The single to be produced by Bulawayo’s fast-rising producer, Innora, will be available on a number of digital platforms. “Since the start of the lockdown, I’ve been analysing the way people are adapting to the pandemic. I realised that people have been pushed beyond the limit and so I decided to work on a song that would communicate this. “Teach me to trust you focuses on challenges of faith and hope when people face hardships. It’s expected to hit the airwaves soon,” Sis Ntoe said. She said the song was also a cry to God to assist people overcome the hardships that have been worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. Sis Ntoe who is the lead vocalist for the Word of Life Church choir in Entumbane, released her debut album, Halala ngoJesu this year. — mthabisi_mthire.
