GOSPEL musician Beke “BK” Mguni is riding high with his recent offering, a song titled Wamuhle, as it is topping the Skyz Metro FM radio charts. The charts which are voted for by the public saw the track which is off the artiste’s Ngiyakholwa eight-track album, land a spot in the top five of the Gospel Top 10 chart show this past week. The song which made number two, moving up five positions from last week, was produced by Bulawayo’s fast-rising producer Neshville at his Rock Up Studios. It features Awah Brian. Onesimo Ngcotsha’s Sisize Somandla took the top spot while Minister Lindani’s Touya Ishe – a new entry, Mai Mwamuka’s Zita Renyu and Vusa Mangena’s Sabela completed the top five. BK said he was elated by the support the song is receiving from the public. “I’m happy that I’m on the right track amid the pandemic as shown by my song which has landed on the top 10 charts. This is a clear sign that my music is satisfying my fans and the public at large. “I’m humbled with the support from the people and I’ll continue to produce good, quality songs that touch their souls and entertain them,” said BK. The artiste who turned 35 yesterday said other than Wamuhle, the Ngiyakholwa album which was released in May has tracks, Bambelela, Uthando lukababa, Ngiyakholwa ft Ntethelelo Ndlovu, Ngizombonga ngani, Singayaphi, Uyingcwele and Sizomlandela. – @mthabisi_mthire.
