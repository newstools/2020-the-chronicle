COMPANIES can only survive the adverse impact of Covid-19 pandemic if they take measures to prevent or curb the spread of the pandemic while at the same time striving to keep their market share. The global economy has been plagued by the Covid-19 pandemic, which was first detected in China last December. As part of broader measures to prevent the spread of the disease, countries across the world have, among other guidelines and protocols, enforced lockdowns. Speaking during a post-Covid-19 strategic business renewal webinar organised by the Buy Zimbabwe Initiative last Thursday, Professor Steyn Heckroodt said: “Our research has shown that if companies focus on adopting the preventive measures to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic by saving the lives of their employees, they are likely to survive the adverse effects of Covid-19. So far companies have managed to keep their market share during this period of the pandemic and what is also critical is to maintain good relations with their supply chain.” The business event was held with the objective of assisting companies to recover from the adverse effects of Covid-19 that has so far killed close to a million people globally. The disease has also crippled economies as many countries have been forced to enforce travel restrictions and reduce economic activities. Prof Heckroodt said for companies to survive, it was also imperative for management to understand the correlation between future fit leadership skills and competitive financial sustainability. Many companies are facing survival challenges as a result of Covid-19 economic disruptions. It is against this background that Buy Zimbabwe has said the inaugural online event was running under the theme “The Post-Covid-19 Strategic Renewal and Realignment Surgeries”. — @okazunga
