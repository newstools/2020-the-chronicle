BULAWAYO Volleyball Association (BVA) chairperson William Mazviro says hope of having a normal season this year are fading away with each passing week and mire effort is now being placed on getting action in beach volleyball. The BVA season was initially set to begin in March before all sporting activities were suspended and that it has been classified among high risk sports means it is unlikely to resume action anytime soon. Mazviro said a normal season at this time was virtually impossible. “At present we are not sure if we will have our normal volleyball season. We are, however, hoping to at least have something on beach volleyball since it only involves very few players, two-a-side, and we feel conditions may be more acceptable for that. We are also hoping to hold some courses online to capacitate our officials to be ready when normal volleyball resumes,” said Mazviro.
BVA was planning a big shift from the normal 6-a-side volleyball to beach volleyball and sitting volleyball competitions. Mazviro revealed that they had already applied for the Government’s Covid-19 relief fund through the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association and Sports and Recreation Commission to assist during this long period of inactivity. He said the association’s player’s commission was also working tirelessly to assist players during this period. — @innocentskizoe
