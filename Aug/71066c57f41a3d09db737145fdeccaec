THE Redcliff Municipality has started construction work under its ambitious town expansion project. The local authority recently announced plans to expand its Central Business District (CBD) towards the Harare-Bulawayo Highway as it seeks to unlock new development opportunities. Redcliff Town Clerk, Mr Gilson Chakauya, said there was a need to expand the CBD in keeping with modern development trends. “We have plans to expand our CBD towards areas where development is taking place. This move will see more construction work taking place around the Redcliff turn-off area and along the highway where development is taking place,” said Mr Chakauya. He said service stations, a truckers’ inn and fast foods outlets will soon be constructed in the new CBD area . “You will soon witness massive construction work around the turnoff area as many companies are already busy with preparations. We expect more investors to come in to work on differnt projects,” he said. One of the companies that has hit the ground running is Rockodox Petroleum which has started constructing a service station. The company’s operations manager, Mr Michael Ndlovu, said construction of the US$500 000 service station should be completed by end of the year. “We are glad to be associated with Redcliff town and we were the first to acquire land around the area. We are already constructing a service station that will have space for grocery shops, fast foods outlets and a truckers’ inn,” said Mr Ndlovu. He said the target was to complete all construction work before the end of the year. “We have already mobilised the required materials and we expect to have completed work by December this year,” said Mr. Ndlovu. The development is very positive for Redcliff town which has over the years heavily relied on the now defunct Ziscosteel.
