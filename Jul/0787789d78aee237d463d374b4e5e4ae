Two illegal gold panners died on the spot while another escaped with minor injuries after a shaft they were working in Kwekwe collapsed on Tuesday.  Police confirmed the incident. “Police are investigating the death of two gold panners who died after a shaft collapsed on Tuesday morning in Mbizo 15,” said Midlands police spokesman Assistant Inspector Joel Goko. He said a third panner was rescued alive and rushed to Kwekwe General Hospital where he later disappeared. “We are not yet sure of the motive behind him running away, we will share more information as investigations unfold,” he said. This news crew visited the mining site in Mbizo and police were taking away the second body that had been retrieved by residents. The shaft, located between Mbizo 15 and Mbizo 8 suburbs is within residential stands. Sources said there might be another body trapped underground. “We knew this crew from way back, they have always worked as a group of four. Only three have been accounted for. We strongly suspect there might be another body underground,” said a source on condition of anonymity. Onlooker urged relevant authorities to consider digging deeper, in case another body was still trapped.
