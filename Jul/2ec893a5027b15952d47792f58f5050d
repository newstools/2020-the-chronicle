THE Premier Soccer League has mourned the sudden passing away of its former chief executive officer Chris Sambo. Sambo died at Parirenyatwa Hospital on Wednesday five days after celebrating his 69th birthday. According to Sambo’s Lifelong Footballers Trust colleague Francis Zimunya, the former Blackpool chief executive officer passed away at a time he was busy working on bringing to life a multipurpose football complex in Harare and had brought in investors to fund the project. In a condolence message issued by communication and media liaison officer Kudzai Bare, the PSL said it had learnt with deep shock and sadness of the untimely passing away of Sambo, whom it said was a passionate and dedicated football servant of the game he loved. The PSL said Sambo served with distinction and advocated for the full commercialisation of football and also facilitated various competitions and sponsorship models as the league’s chief executive officer. “His life, work and generosity will always be remembered by everyone who had the opportunity of working with him. As we mourn his sad departure, we celebrate his immense contribution in the development of local football. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Sambo family, friends and the entire football family. May the Lord comfort you during this difficult time,” said Bare. Former PSL secretary general, Mwandibhuya Mutepfa, now based abroad, took to Facebook to mourn the passing of Sambo, whom he worked with. “I can not believe that you are gone my brother Chris. You were a true brother during our administration at PSL. You helped me when I was SG; we stood our ground on some issues that needed real men. Football will miss you. We treated all clubs the same, big or small without fear or favour. Go well Chriss Faranando Sambo,” wrote Mutepfa. Sambo was expected to be laid to rest yesterday.
