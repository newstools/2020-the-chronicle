THREE armed men robbed a 44-year-old woman from Newtown West suburb in Bulawayo of her car, US$400 and a cellphone. The woman was driving into the city centre from her home in her Nissan Sylphy Bluebird registration number ADX 6823 when she was carjacked by the trio she had given a lift. The incident occurred at about 9.30AM along Cecil Drive towards Matopos Road. The trio is said to have attacked the woman after she made a stop at the request of one of them. The robbers who were armed with a pistol and a knife, chocked the complainant and forced her out of her car before they sped off. The suspects are still on the run. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said those who might have information that may lead to the arrest of the suspects should contact any nearest police station. “We are investigating a case of a woman from Newton West suburb who lost her valuables to robbers. She gave a lift to three male adults who claimed they wanted to get to town. Along the way one of them said he had forgotten something and requested that she makes a U-turn so that he picks the item. The suspect ordered her to stop the car. The passengers at the back seat suddenly attacked her from behind and started chocking her while at the same time pushing her out of the car. They then produced a pistol and threatened to shoot her,” said Insp Ncube. He said one of the suspects jumped into the driver’s seat and drove off. “The victim lost her car and valuables that were in the car including a Samsung J cellphone worth US$150 and US$400. We strongly warn members of the public against giving lifts to strangers,” said Insp Ncube. — @nqotshili
