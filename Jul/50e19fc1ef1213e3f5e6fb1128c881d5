MPILO Central Hospital’s paediatric ward got a shot in the arm yesterday after receiving thick bleach worth $8, 000 from Marketers Association OF Zimbabwe (MAZ). The donation is part of the company’s effort to fight Covid-19 which has infected 14 nurses at the institution. MAZ donated 100 litres of bleach. Mrs Stella Nkomo from MAZ southern region said the bleach was sourced from proceeds of a walkathon which the company hosted. “Last year we had a walkathon for a worthy cause and we decided to used it to buy the bleach for Mpilo. We will continue to mobilize more so that our public institution is well equipped in the fight against the global pandemic,” said Mrs Nkomo. She said the bleach will help health care workers in the paediatric ward stay safe. Mpilo Central Hospital acting chief executive officer Dr Solwayo Ngwenya thanked the company and said the donation would save lives. “We live in difficult times especially now that we are battling with increased Covid-19 cases countrywide and in Bulawayo. We continue doing our best to protect healthcare workers serving our clients and we are grateful for such donations,” said Dr Ngwenya.
