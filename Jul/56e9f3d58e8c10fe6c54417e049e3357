To protect this image, its owner, Ndebele who travels as far as Turkey to buy her stock, always flushes out chancers by out rightly refusing to accommodate those who always ask for discounts. Long and short, if you cannot afford her price, it means you do not qualify to be in the shop in the first place. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-505757" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/DA0A475F-60AB-4BD2-9758-A96C8F515DBF.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/DA0A475F-60AB-4BD2-9758-A96C8F515DBF.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/DA0A475F-60AB-4BD2-9758-A96C8F515DBF-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Because of its popularity and the way it has been branded, the boutique seems to be on the bucket list for many women who want to join the winning team and also appreciate stylish and finer things in life. Among these women is fast-rising media personality, former Skyz Metro FM presenter, Patience Phiri who this week, confessed that for the past four years, she has been longing to one day, raise enough funds to buy a clothing item at the boutique. Posting what seemed like an entrance mat of the shop on her Facebook page on Sunday morning, Phiri said: “One day, I will make enough money to be able to afford shopping at #Posh. I took this picture in 2016 as a reminder nje ukuthi ngizaze ngiyithwale ishopping bag yakhona s’tru. “So when you see me posting my #Posh bag, celebrate with me. One day is one day!” It seems being seen holding the Posh bag is a sign of one making it in life as the bag does not come cheap. The clothes range from US$180 to US$500. Phiri went on to praise Ndebele who single-handedly runs the boutique, for her hard work. “Inkosi ikubusise, ibusise lemsebenzi yezandla zakho,” wrote Phiri. Hopefully, Phiri who loves her doeks and beads will one day raise enough money to buy even the smallest accessory at the posh boutique.
