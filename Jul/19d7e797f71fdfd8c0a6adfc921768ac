A Gweru prophetess, arrested for allegedly sexually molesting a female member of her church, has been granted bail. Juliet Masakanire (29), the founder and pastor of Pray Deliverance and Testimony Ministries International is alleged to have sexually molested a 32-year-old member of her church. Masakanire appeared before Gweru magistrate Mr Progress Murandu facing aggravated indecent assault charges. She was not asked to plead and was granted $1 000 bail to August 28. Prosecutor, Ms Connie Madzudzu told the court that the complainant whose name has been withheld to protect her identity is a Pray Deliverance and Testimony Ministries International church member. It is the Stateâ€™s case that sometime in January, the accused person was looking for accommodation and the complainant offered to accommodate her temporarily. The duo allegedly used to share the same bed. The court heard that during the same month, Masakanire in a prophecy said the complainant was going to get married to a husband by the name of Stanley Chinyonga. Each night since the day of the prophecy, the accused person allegedly started to speak to the complainant in a male voice saying she was Stanley Chinyonga and wanted to marry her. The court heard that on an unknown date during the month of February, Masakanire allegedly woke up during the night and introduced herself as Stanley Chinyonga and started kissing and caressing the complainant. The complainant tried to resist but she was overpowered. The accused person allegedly inserted her fingers into her private parts. She did that on four different occasions and threatened her not to tell anyone saying if she did that she would not meet her future husband. On June 28 the complainant allegedly informed a church mate before the matter was reported to the police leading to the arrest of the accused person.
