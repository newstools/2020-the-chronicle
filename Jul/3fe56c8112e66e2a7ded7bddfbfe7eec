According to the State papers the gang went to the mine at night and attacked Mr Freeman Jele while he was asleep with his two workmates. “On 16 July at around 9PM the complainant, Mr Freeman Jele was asleep with his two workmates in a makeshift tent near their shaft at Olympus Mine when they were awakened by the accused persons who were throwing stones at them. Mr Jele and his workmates tried to flee but one of the accused persons struck him with an axe on the forehead and he fell to the ground while his workmates hid in the shaft. The accused persons ganged up on the complainant and continued to assault him and they took his cellphone,” reads the court papers. “The accused persons then ordered the complainant’s workmates who were now hiding inside the shaft to come out and they refused. The gang then dragged Mr Jele and ordered him to get into the shaft as well. They then set alight an explosive which they then threw into the shaft.” While Mr Jele and his workmates were in the shaft the accused persons took 150 by 50kg bags of gold ore belonging to the complainant and his workmates. The matter was reported to the police who conducted investigations leading to arrest of the gang and recovery of 45 of the bags. — @DubeMatutu
