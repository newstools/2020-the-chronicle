South Africa-based maskandi musician Alson Mandla Thebe who hails from Tsholotsho has started working on his fourth album which is set to be released by end of year. Sgodo, as the artiste is referred to, is popularly known for his track uMugabe which was released in 2016. Still riding high on his third album, Uzongibona, released last year Sgodo said: “I’ve started working on my fourth album which is set to have 14 tracks. I’m planning to launch it before year-end. “In order to hype up fans, I’ll be dropping a single next month so that I also get input from them.” He said work on the album was disrupted by Covid-19 which has hit the neighbouring country which is currently ranking fifth globally among countries worst affected by the pandemic. The artiste who prides himself with his culture said the album will feature a collaboration with Alie Mgube and two artistes who he will unveil at a later stage. He said he is also working on a DVD titled The Best of Ishodo Esikhub’abathakathi which will be released in November. Judging from his top drawer performance with his Izicimamlilo band at his debut online show at Hillbrow Theatre last week, fans should expect visual fireworks. “As we abide and continue to be faced with the pandemic, I’m working on a DVD that will include songs from the start of my journey. This DVD is my way of cheering up fans in South Africa and back home and giving them hope that one day, we shall reunite and have the greatest of times,” Sgodo said. In his previous albums namely Bangijikijela Ngamatshe, Final Signature and Uzongibona Kahle, Sgodo worked with a number of artistes including Allen Ndoda, Mgqilazi, Mfana weKhansela, Ngiga and Snegugu Shushu with the songs being recorded at GMZone Studios and produced by Nyandeni. – @mthabisi_mthire.
