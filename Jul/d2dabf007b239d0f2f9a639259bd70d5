HAVING in the past claimed the throne as Bulawayo’s Gqom music queen, musician-cum-dancer Samantha “Samza” Mazibisa has opened up on how resources have stalled her debut album. Known in the music circles as the Naughty Queen, the artiste who for a long time lived under Sandra “Sandy” Ndebele’s shadow, shot to fame with her titillating single titled Indod’yomnikazi, which during its days was a club banger. Borrowing her style from South African singer and dancer Thembi Seete, the 27-year-old musician said the industry is no child’s play. “The arts industry is very hard to penetrate. There are so many ups and downs and it is worse when you don’t have the finances. I’ve no manager or anyone who supports me with the necessary things so I have to hustle everything on my own. “All the singles that I have worked on in the past need HD quality videos that cost a lot, recording also needs money, there are photo shoots that need to be done and so for me honestly, it’s been very hard to get to the top. Sometimes I cry But with God, I’m hoping things will get better with time,” said the Naughty Queen. Despite all these hurdles, Samza said she is working on her debut album with which she hopes to promote her works with. As a way to tease fans, she has been releasing singles consistently which have been a mixture of Gqom and Amapiano. A single which was produced by HitKid of Flamers Studio in the city centre is set to be launched on August 10. “I’m back with a new sound called Gqom-Amapiano which is a mix of Gqom and Amapiano sounds. The forthcoming single is about infidelity and prostitution gone wrong,” said Samza. – @mthabisi_mthire.
