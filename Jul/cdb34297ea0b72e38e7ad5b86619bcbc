Speaking from Masvingo where she is currently working on the visuals of the single,Minister Lindani said she promoted the song online as she wanted to popularise her work. “I created a WhatsApp group and invited people to join. A number of radio presenters joined as well as several political leaders. Sheila Vundla who is based in the UK was the highest forex bidder while musician Paula was the highest local currency bidder. “I was inspired to come up with this plan following the era we are in of the pandemic were as artistes, we’re unable to have live shows,” said Minister Lindani. She said the single is a prayer song for the nation which also seeks forgiveness from God. “As the word of God says that if my people who are called by name shall humble themselves and pray, I will heal them, I feel we need God to heal our land from the pandemic and economic wise. “Currently, I’m shooting the visuals for the song at Great Zimbabwe and I’m anticipating to release the video around Heroes Day or by end of August,” she said.
