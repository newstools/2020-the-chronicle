The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Another Zimbabwean film production titled S/He Is Perfect is set to premiere on streaming platforms Amazon Fire TV and Roku TV on July 17 through an American distributor. A 48-minute feature film, S/HE IS PERFECT was shot in April by Lightwave Choir during the lockdown in Bulawayo, a first for the music production company. Written by Khaliphile Sibanda, the feature film features Dumolwethu Moyo as Esihle, Priator Mhlanga who plays Funeka, Moses Kamanga as Babongile and Sanelisiwe Ncube as Nonhle. Other cast members are Bongani Mpala as Mncube, Rujeko Chavhunduka as Noxolo, Thulisile Gumpo as Sindiswa, Alex Marowa as Lubanzi, Methembe Ndlovu as Melisizwe and Sizolwenkosi Siwela as Baby Obelindelwe. Sibanda said S/HE IS PERFECT depicts a triangular love affair where two close friends fall for one guy and later discover how he was playing them. “The pandemic is not a time to relax, but to continue with our projects hence why we worked on this film. We were however forced to break down our scenes to avoid everyone coming on set at one go. So it was about three to five people on set with the setting being NRZ buildings in the city. “An American distributor saw some of my work and was pleased with it and that’s how this film landed on these international streaming platforms,” said Sibanda. Sibanda has in the past worked on Ziyathunqa, a collage of short dramas which aired on ZBCTv. She is currently working on the Ziyathunqa 2020 series and has also been selected for the Rwanda leaders summit 2020 and Women Playwrights International conference Canada 2021 through the play He Doesn’t Have A Backbone. The premiere of Sibanda’s film on the international streaming platforms will follow Cook Off which premiered on Netflix recently. @mthabisi_mthire
