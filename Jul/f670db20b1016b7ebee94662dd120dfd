ZIFA Southern Region has received its share of $1.6 million Covid-19 relief fund from the national association. The money is part of the US$1.8 million football rescue package from Fifa and Caf to assist clubs survive the adverse effects of the pandemic. Zifa Southern Region chairman Andrew Tapela said his committee meets tomorrow to decide on how to distribute the funds. “We’ve received the funds and now what’s left is for the executive to meet before meeting our constituency. After Saturday afternoon, I should be in a position to state what direction we are taking,” Tapela. The Premier Soccer League got the biggest chunk of $25,7 million (US$390 197). Each of the 18 topflight clubs will get an equivalent of about US$5 000, with the bulk of the money going towards Covid-19 tests for players and support staff.
