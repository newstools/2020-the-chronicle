AFRO-soul musician Msiz’kay and producer DJ Sox are slowly joining the Amapiano genre after collaborating for an Amapiano single titled Uzobuya Nini. The genre is very popular and has been appreciated globally through Zimbabwe’s Sha Sha (Amapiano Queen) who recently scooped a BET in the Viewer’s Choice: Best International Act category. Uzobuya Nini is a song which talks about long distance relationships and one lover longing for his/her other half who left with a promise to return soon. It is a relatable story that is told well by the duo. As the lockdown has incapacitated many relationships, the song which was produced by DJ Sox under the South Grooves Entertainment label, is worth listening to as it comforts and brings hope that one day, one will hold hands with the love of their life, wine and dine for a prosperous future. The track which was released earlier this month is already getting radio airplay on the city’s radio stations. Msiz’kay who has done a couple of House/Amapiano songs, said he is slowly jellying up to the genre that he loves. “I’ve done some house features before as well as one or two Amapiano features with other producers and I loved the instrumental the moment I heard it. It was a pleasure working on this banger,” he said. – @mthabisi_mthire.
