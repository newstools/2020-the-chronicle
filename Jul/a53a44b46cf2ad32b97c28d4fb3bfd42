BEITBRIDGE-based musician-cum-producer Regis Takunda Mandangu has pleaded with radio DJs to stop snubbing artistes from small towns because of their location. The 21-year-old reggae/dancehall artiste who uses the stage name Mark Geezo, has been in the game since 2013 and has worked with Lady Squanda’s After 8 record label which he was signed to at the age of 14. Recently, he produced fast-rising Bhadilah’s EP Mpho ‘nga’ Mpho. Speaking from his base in Beitbridge, Mark Geezo who was motivated to venture into music by his brother, Marcus ‘Razor Man’ Mandangu who runs a record label, said it is time artistes, especially in Matabeleland South and small towns, are given recognition. He said it was saddening how some DJs from radio stations actually charge them for their songs to be played saying this was stifling the local music industry. “Many radio DJs tend to focus on what Harare has to offer thereby ignoring other areas. I’ve had encounters where radio DJs would want to get paid for a song to get airplay. “My only hope is that these DJs give artistes from Matabeleland South and other areas a chance,” said Mark Geezo. A University of Zimbabwe Media and Journalism student, Mark Geezo said he will use his academic skills to come up with innovative measures in order to be recognised. “I’m working on an EP that’ll unveil my ability as a musician and an up-and-coming producer. Through the EP, I want to reveal that I’m able to sing on any beat as long I maintain the common reggae that people associate me with. — @mthabisi_mthire.
