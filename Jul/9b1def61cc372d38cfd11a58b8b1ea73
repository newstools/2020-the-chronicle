Chained by Reality, a film which is set to portray the general life of the girl child, is expected to start shooting in Bulawayo next week. The film which is being produced by Ibrah Film Production Company was written by Beverley Mlilo and will be produced by Ibraheem Kuvawoga. It will be centred on five beautiful young ladies. “Chained by Reality is a story of five beauties who go on a night out but things unexpectedly take a twist and secrets are revealed,” said Kuvawoga. Through this film, a first for the production company, Kuvawoga said they want to highlight issues which affect the girl child. “Issues that will be revealed in the film include dark secrets, the true meaning of friendship, betrayal, depression, suicide ideation, deceit and backstabbing. “At the end of the day, our motive is to encourage the girl child to open up if they are experiencing some kind of abuse in their lives,” he said. In order to make the film refreshing, Kuvawoga said he chose to work with up-and-coming actors that include model Rosina Nothemba Tapela and Nompumelelo Mpofu. By doing this, the producer said he also wanted to change the perception that for a production to bloom, there should be known actors. “Gone are the days that for a film to make it, the cast should be famous. I want to create a situation where the up-and-coming actors and actresses are given a chance to make a name for themselves. “We had auditions for the roles and we’ll be announcing the other successful candidates in due course,” said Kuvawoga. Once complete, Kuvawoga said the short film will be sent to DStv’s Zambezi Magic where they hope to have it premiered sometime in October. — @mthabisi_mthire.
