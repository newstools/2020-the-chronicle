THREE armed men robbed a 44-year-old woman from Newtown West suburb in Bulawayo of US$400 and a cellphone before getting away in her car on Wednesday. The woman was driving into the city centre from her home in her Nissan Sylphy Bluebird with registration number ADX 6823. She gave a lift to three male hikers who attacked her. The incident occurred at about 9:30AM along Cecil Drive towards Matopos Road. The trio are said to have attacked the woman after she made a stop at the request of one of the assailants. It is alleged that the robbers were armed with a pistol and a knife and chocked her as they forced her out of the car before they sped off. The suspects are still on the run. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said those who might have information that may lead to the arrest of the suspect should come forward. “We are investigating a case where a woman from Newton West lost her valuables to robbers. She gave a lift to three male adults who claimed they wanted to get to town. Along the way one of them exclaimed that he had forgotten something and requested that she makes a U-turn so that he picks the item. The suspect ordered her to stop the car. The passengers in the back seat started chocking and pushing her out of the car while producing a weapon,” said Insp Ncube. He said one of the suspects jumped into the driver’s seat and took off. “The victim lost her car and valuables that were in the car including a Samsung J cellphone worth US$150 and US$400 in cash. We strongly warn members of the public against giving lifts to people they don’t know as some of them turn out to be criminals,” he said. -@nqotshili
