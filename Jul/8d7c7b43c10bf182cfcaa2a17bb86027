NEW kid on the hip-hop scene, Bulawayo’s Boy Nino (real name Nigel Bhebhe) who has been teasing people about his song that features South Africa’s multi-award-winning hip hop sensation, Emtee, will finally be releasing it today. Titled No Problems, the song that was produced by Sama-nominated producer, Murphy Cubic, is due to be released on all music platforms. The 23-year-old from Kumalo said he cannot wait to share the song which he wants to use to put local music on the map. He said they recorded it during the lockdown but unfortunately, could not work on its visuals because of travel restrictions. “The collaboration was done during the Covid-19 pandemic and I’m glad that finally, the song is coming out. We’d have wanted the song to be accompanied by a video but unfortunately, the lockdown restricted us from producing the music video. “However, people must look forward to the video once lockdown restrictions are raised,” said Boy Nino. He said the song, which is part of an EP he is working on, is about self-progress and a person not wanting bad vibes from rivals and old friends. The collaboration with the Roll Up hit-maker, Boy Nino said, will go a long way in advancing his career. Having ventured into the music industry in 2018, Boy Nino has a number of productions, among them a three-track EP titled Perpetual which has songs Dime, Two Player Mode and Wave that featured Kyla Blac. He is known for his single titled Work that was released last year and featured award-winning artiste 2Yung. – @mthabisi_mthire.
