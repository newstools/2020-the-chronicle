THE Parliamentary Portfolio Committee  on Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation is in Bulawayo today and will tour Barbourfields Stadium that is undergoing refurbishments in an effort to make it compliant with Fifa and Caf standards. The oversight committee, chaired by Chivi North MP Mathias Tongofa, will also hold a brief plenary session with officials from the Bulawayo City Council, the stadium owners. Council is expected to brief the committee on the progress made so far as well as constraints they are facing in a bid to meet the standards, which Caf president Ahmad Ahmad recently said might even be tightened to ensure the safety of players, officials and spectators in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Council might also brief the committee on  proposals to build a new state of the art stadium, whose site has already been identified, according to last week’s council minutes. The committee will field questions from the media where the 2014 Ausc Region 5 Under-20 Youth Games forensic report is likely to take centre stage. The auditors issued a very adverse report and implicated a number of high ranking government officials as well as senior members of the local organising committee led by chairperson Khonzani Ncube and chief executive officer Elkannah Dube.
