UP-and-coming gospel artiste, Felix Muleya popularly known as Man of Peace has ventured into hairdressing as a way to raise funds to sustain his musical career and also fend for the vulnerable. Like most artistes, Muleya who hails from the Kariangwe in Binga, has been affected by the ongoing lockdown as he cannot stage shows as normal. As such, he has been forced to look for other means to survive hence his decision to venture into hairdressing, which he said, was still not good enough. For a long time, Muleya had an ambition to set up a charity fund which he would use to send orphans to school and take care of the elderly, but due to financial constraints, this has been impossible. His determination to help the vulnerable is the one that is pushing him to look for other means of survival. “My current job (hairdresser) is not paying enough for me to fulfil my ambition since whatever I’m getting now is from hand to mouth. If I get excess, I use it for my music career and I’ll be left with nothing to share with the vulnerable,” he said. However, the artiste said he will not tire as he really wants to change the lives of the vulnerable. “My greatest wish is to have sponsors or partners come on board and support my music career so that I realise my insatiable desire to help orphans. In most cases, especially in these tough times, if one is an orphan and elderly, chances are high that life will be tough for them so this is why I want to play a fatherly role of orphans,” he said. Muleya began his music career in 2010 and managed to record his debut eight-track album titled Mwami Waluse in 2017 with his Mercy of God band. “My music is in Tonga, Ndebele, Shona and English as I want it to reach out to everyone in the country and beyond our borders,” he said. His second album which is due for release anytime soon is titled Musatisiye Baba.
