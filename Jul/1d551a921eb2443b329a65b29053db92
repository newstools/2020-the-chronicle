The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) has granted Bulawayo’s Body Works Gyms permission to re-open under strict Covid-19 guidelines. Gyms and fitness studios were among businesses forced to close their doors when the Covid-19 pandemic struck Zimbabwe. Body Works Gyms manager Donavan Ashborne said their two facilities will open on Monday next week and will only accommodate 30 people per hour. “We have been granted permission by the Sports and Recreation Commission to reopen our gyms under strict guidelines. Our gyms are reopening to our members on Monday 13 July. We are really excited that fitness enthusiasts can now come and train to keep their bodies in shape. Our two studios will accommodate 30 people per hour,” said Ashborne. Their clients will be expected to use gloves when using machines or weights, and will not be allowed to use the showers. People will also be required to bring their own drinking water. No one will be allowed into the changing rooms so those that book for workouts have to come already dressed in their training gear. Statutory Instrument 94 of 2020 permits outdoor exercise during the lockdown and residents now have time to set and attain fitness goals . Scores of people have had a chance to do a number of outdoor physical activities, which include aerobics, jogging and a variety of exercises. To the public, exercising is one way of beating Covid-19 as health experts say exercising helps boost one’s immune system. According to the World Health Organisation, regular physical activity benefits both the body and mind and can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. — @FungaiMuderere
