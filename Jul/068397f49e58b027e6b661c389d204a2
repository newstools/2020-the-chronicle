The Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS) Bulawayo Metropolitan province’s rehabilitation programmes including a drama the prisoners were working on, have been thwarted by the Covid-19 pandemic. ZPCS with the help from the national broadcaster, ZBC, was working on a drama series titled Crime and Strings when the pandemic struck worldwide resulting in Government imposing a national lockdown. Under the partnership, ZBC was providing the crew while ZPCS provided the cast and script. Work on the series has since been suspended as a result of the lockdown. The provincial principal correction officer (PCO) Risias Chikwetu said work on the series should have been completed by now. “As Rehabilitation and Reintegration section, our programming was adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The drama series was supposed to be out by now,” he said. PCO Chikwetu said the drama production was also affected when some of the inmates benefited from the Presidential Amnesty which was meant to decongest the country’s prisons. The PCO said unlocking hidden talents among inmates is the motive behind initiatives such as the drama series project. “Since prisons strongly believe in giving inmates a second chance after they have served their sentences, the inmates are engaged in various projects meant to equip them with skills to use on their release,” he said. The writer of the drama series, Correctional Officer Grade 1 (CO1) Taremeredzwa Kwangwari (Tare True Defender) said he was hopeful they will continue with the project once the situation improves. “The cast and the crew are ready to resume work on the project once the lockdown is over,” he said.
