THE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has temporarily closed the Revenue Hall to pave way for disinfection of the building but officials yesterday could not immediately comment on claims that this is as a result of a staff member who has allegedly tested Covid-19 positive. Business will resume tomorrow and members of the public have been advised to utlise digital payment platforms during the closure. In a statement, the Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube said the Revenue Hall will be closed today. “The City of Bulawayo would like to advise members of the public that the Revenue Hall will be temporarily closed on Thursday (July 30) to allow for the cleaning and disinfection of the premises as a precautionary member in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The building will re-open on Friday, 31 July for normal business and members of the public can make use of digital platforms and our website for transactions,” said Mr Dube. Last night, council senior public relations officer Mrs Nesisa Mpofu had not responded to questions following claims that a council employee stationed at Revenue Hall had tested positive on Tuesday leading to the decision to disinfect the whole building. The development comes as four nurses, a nurse aide and a cleaner at council’s Pelandaba Clinic tested positive. According to the council, the nurse developed mild symptoms last week and was sent home for self-isolation before three more nurses, a nurse aide and a cleaner tested positive on Monday. It appears the nurse was infected during the funeral wake and it’s not clear how many more people were infected. — @thamamoe
