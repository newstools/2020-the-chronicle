Lack of financial resources has affected a Victoria Falls Pentecostal church pastor, Ndaniso Maphosa’s music career as he has not been able to record his second album which he hopes to announce his music comeback with. Having begun singing at a tender age when he was still in Grade Five, 48-year-old Pastor Maphosa had hoped to have made it big by now. But sadly, this remains a dream. He recorded his debut eight-track album titled Ngamanxeba in 2012 at Moonlight Studios in Bulawayo. His career seemed promising as he caught the attention of the likes of Thabiso Mswethe, Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave and Revonia Khumalo who he shared the stage with at various gospel shows. But since then, the artiste who became a pastor in 2005 at Maranatha Pentecostal Church, has been struggling to raise money to record his second album. As such, he is looking for a studio that can record his album, UThixo Uyimpendulo Ezweni LeZimbabwe as he believes that his calling is to minister through music. “I developed an interest for music in 1986 when I was in Grade Five. I recorded my first album in 2012 which has the songs Ngamanxeba, Revive me, Sithethelele Baba, Simnqobile Usathane, Ithemba Lami LikuJesu, UJesu Uyeza Masinyane, Buya Buya Moni, Iluba LaseSharon,” said Pastor Maphosa. He said he had challenges marketing his music from the first album as it was in the old cassette format. He also could not re-record as he had no money. Ngamanxeba, Buya Buya Moni, Simnqobile USathane and Ithemba Lami LikuJesu were hits, reckons Pastor Maphosa. “My mission is to preach through music. What I have learnt all these years is that patience is a virtue. You have to be patient in life and wait for God’s time. I have many songs that are yet to be released and one of them is UThixo Uyimpendulo Ezweni leZimbabwe which I plan to release anytime this year,” he said. – @ncubeleon
