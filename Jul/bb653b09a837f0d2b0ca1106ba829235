PROVINCIAL karate chairperson Sensei Ndabezinhle Mazibuko says they are pinning thier hopes on the Sports and Recreation Commission to allow for resumption of non-contact training soon. Mazibuko said there has not been much work on the provincial side as they await the SRC to give them the greenlight to resume activities. “We are yet to meet as the provincial association, as we are waiting for the SRC response to the Zimbabwe Karate Union’s  application to resume non-contact training,” said Mazibuko. ZKU applied to the SRC seeking approval to practice non-contact competition and training. “We shall limit our training to only kata and kihon where there is absolutely no physical contact between instructors and athletes. Kata and kihon training are done through social Iearning (observing and imitating what the instructor is demonstrating). Competition will be limited to kata alone. There shall be no physical contact among athletes,” reads parts of ZKU’s letter to the SRC.
