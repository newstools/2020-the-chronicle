ORGANISERS of the Highlanders debt clearance crowdfunding initiative are confident they will clear the club’s arrears at the end of this month if fans can match their June contributions. Bosso’s debt stands at $862 868 and the group handed to Bosso $300 000 collected in June for the project. This was in addition to the $100 000 raised in May. The initiative is being spearheaded by South African-based Bosso member Nodumo Nyathi and was launched in May to help the club clear its debt and begin channelling money to other development projects. “I’m pleased to report to Highlanders sons and daughters that we’ve released to the club the second instalment of funds collected in June which is $300 000. On behalf of the Bosso debt clearance campaign, I’d like to thank those who have selflessly contributed to the worthy cause of clearing the debt. To those who are yet to contribute, they can do so using bank accounts opened in South Africa and Zimbabwe,” said Nyathi. “Our hope is to wrap up the project by monthend. We can do it if we work together as sons and daughters of Highlanders”. Highlanders have used the money to pay former players and institutions they owe. “We paid about 25 former players and coaches. We decided to use the first batch to pay some former players and coaches. “We’re thankful to those contributing and the initiative because the debt has always been a burden to the club. We’ve tried to deliberately come up with means to deal with the debt. Commitment to clear the debt has always been there,” said Ronald Moyo, the Highlanders’ spokesperson. — @ZililoR
