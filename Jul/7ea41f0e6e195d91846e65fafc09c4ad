BULAWAYO Basketball Association secretary-general Francis Dube is hoping that Covid-19 would be under control by the time the country gets into summer to allow the city to host the Southern Africa 3X3 basketball tournament in December. Ten countries have confirmed their participation in the fourth edition of the Southern Africa 3X3 Under-18 basketball tournament to be held in Bulawayo from December 3-6. “At the moment we are preparing for the regional competition. We are hoping by then (December) Covid-19 will be under control and borders will be open and people can travel. We have begun drawing budgets for the competition as well as seeking to secure possible venues from relevant authorities, but for now all is in order and we looking forward to hosting the competition,” said Dube. Angola and Mozambique will not be part of the competition, leaving host nation Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa and Indian Ocean islanders Madagascar and Seychelles to battle it out in the event. The 3X3 basketball is a version of the game played with three players a side scoring in one basketball hoop. Each game is 15 minutes long or ends when one team reaches 21 points, whichever comes first. Zimbabwe won the previous event held in Botswana last year. Basketball alongside football, wrestling, boxing, waterpolo, volleyball, taekwondo, rugby, netball, judo, handball and field hockey have been classified as high risk and are yet to be given the greenlight to resume activities. – @innocentskizoe
