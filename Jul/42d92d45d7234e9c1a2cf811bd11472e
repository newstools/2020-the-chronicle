Boom Cityadvertising also came through and helped with another location,” Mzoe 7 said. “I also worked with Thandanani Woman’s Ensemble, Xtramile dance group, Fudu Media, DJ Prince Eskhosini, Klobber Fusion who dressed the set, Puzzle Moment Pictures,Majoer, Sweetmoby, Skaiva, Mawiza, Mkz, Romanik and many more people from my hood.” The talented musician said the video will be released in the coming weeks adding that he hopes it will be considered for airplay on international channels that include Channel O and MTV Base. @mthabisi_mthire
