GOLDEN Belt has become the first drama production that was wholly shot in Gwanda, to premiere on ZBCtv. It made its debut on the national broadcaster on Sunday at 9pm. The series with 13 episodes was shot in 2018. It was written and produced by Dumoluhle Dube with Stanford Nkomo being the director. Its cast is comprised of up-and-coming and veteran actors from Gwanda and surrounding areas including former Amakorokoza actress and Starbrite 2016 finalist Proficience “Kadder” Cadder, Henry Moyo, Malgan Sibanda, Webson Zenda and Mongeni Khumalo. Funded by the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) through the Zim Digital and Migration programme, Golden Belt chronicles the lives of gold panners and their hope to strike the gold belt. The drama depicts how communities in mining towns relate while also showing the day to day activities of mining people. Following the premiere on ZBCtv, Nkomo said they were elated that people from Gwanda will now be able to watch something they relate to on TV. “We’re very excited and I hope more productions will come out of Gwanda as the place has been underrated in terms of arts,” said Nkomo.
