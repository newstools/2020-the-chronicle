THE Shalom Ballers Volleyball Club who came into existence three years ago, have already set their sights on conquering the nation. The Victoria Falls-based club was formed to promote volleyball in the resort town and surrounding areas. One of the major aims behind the formation of the club is to create a good social base to occupy and empower youths in Victoria Falls. In the short time that the club has been active, it now has its own courts and also acquired a 32-seater bus. It has a membership of 30. When sporting activities were halted in March, the club was preparing to represent Matabeleland North province in the nationals. Team manager Precious Phiri said the club is on an upward course that will see it becoming a force in the next few years. “Shalom Ballers started as a social club from Shalom School as a combination of parents and teachers. “We moved from Shalom School to a community court called Falls Club. “We then started getting some youths and school leavers and a few guys with knowledge of the game. “We started hosting some tournaments locally and I remember our first tournament was in April 2018. “Our men’s team took third position and the ladies took first position. We realised we had the potential to compete at various levels and registered,” said Phiri. She said the club had travelled to play volleyball in places like Hwange, Snamathela, Bulawayo, Kazungula, Botswana and Namibia. “We want to be the best volleyball team in Matebeleland North province and in Zimbabwe,” said Phiri. She revealed that plans were already underway to form beach volleyball teams in line with the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association vision. Each year the club hosts the Shalom Summer Festival where teams from Matabeleland North compete. @innocentskizoe
