PREPARATIONS for the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) inter-provincial championships suffered a setback following Tuesday’s announcement tightening the lockdown and banning intercity travel. Naaz plans to hold its first event in the last weekend of September since all sporting activities were suspended at the onset of the lockdown in March. The event is set for White City Stadium in Bulawayo. Athletics is among sports that had been deemed as low risk by the Sports and Recreation Commission, and given the greenlight to resume activities until Tuesday’s announcement by President Mnangagwa. The surge in Covid-19 cases forced the Government to tighten lockdown restrictions and now the Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) organising committee fears it might be forced to postpone the event. “We hope the ban will be lifted soon. With what is happening at the moment, it’s best to have such restrictions but we believe it shall be well soon,” said Bab chairman Manuel Mpofu. He said the committe will however continue with the preparations hoping the situation will have improved by September. Bab has already initiated the process to book the facility and come up with track events that will fit in a two-hour programme. They are also in the process of securing sanitisers and a thermometer, preparing entries, securing accommodation for travelling provinces, competition officials and securing fumigation chemicals for use after the tournament. — @innocentskizoe.
