ZIMBABWE music producer Murphy Cubic is happy that one of his works, a song titled You by South Africa’s Holly Rey is up for two South African Music Awards (Sama). Murphy Cubic worked with Holly Rey on her EP titled You that was released last year. The eight-track EP for Holly Rey (real name Holly Wasserfall), who is famed for house track Deeper saw Murphy Cubic (real name Mefibosheth Kesani Ncube) producing some of the tracks with You being one of them. The song is nominated in two categories, Record of the year and Music video of the year. Murphy Cubic said the nomination for the song was a huge step in his career. “Being a producer for a Sama nominated song is an achievement on its own. It’s a huge step up in my career and it has motivated me to work even harder for more opportunities like this,” said Murphy Cubic. He said working with Holly Rey was a blessing. “It means a lot or me, my career and the team. The nomination shows that the people love and support the work we do. And being an in-house producer for a really big artiste like Holly Rey is really a blessing,” he said. Over the years, Murphy Cubic who is inspired by South African house music producer, DJ Kent, has produced for Mzansi hip hop artiste MaE on his collaboration with Zimbabwe’s Thuts Rodney, MJ Sings’ EP — Soul & Mind and Lee McHoney’s Sana album. Once in a while, he produces films for television dramas such as Dlala Ngamla that airs on ZBCtv. The 26th Samas will officially take place next month over five days with the virtually-produced show set to air on DStv’s Mzansi Magic. The show will be structured over 30-minute episodes that will air between August 3 and 7. The episodes will be broadcast on Mzansi Magic at 9.30pm, while also streaming on digital platform My Muze.
