SMALL scale farmers in Matabeleland South have been hard hit by the effects of the novel Coronavirus with prices of livestock continuing to tumble. The province has an estimated 700 000 cattle, which among other things is a major source of livelihood. An average successful farmer from the region has between 50 and 200 cattle. According to the National Institution of Livestock Farmers Union, chairperson, Mr Sifiso Sibanda, the state of affairs in the sector is worrisome. “The virus has had a negative impact on many sectors of the economy and the livestock sector has not been spared,” he said. “We have noted some changes in the market when we look at consumer behaviours. In fact not many people now priorities meat on their meals. “The market is depressed and meat as a protein is not moving. For it to remain a blue-chip sector it must move on the market. “This is a reality we must accept to keep our heads above the water. Presently, an average beast is being sold for less than R7000 and even if you want to sell, you don’t get takers, the buyers are depressed.” On a normal environment a good quality beast can fetch about US$1000 or more. Mr Sibanda said many livestock farmers wanting to sell were  being crippled by depressed demand and supply factors, which force desperate farmers to sell at giveaway prices. Even those who wanted to cull or sell livestock were having difficulties considering the current market forces, he said. In some instances, the smallholder farmers are disposing of their animals so that they may be able to get resources to sustainably feed their herds, which have also been affected by drought. Mr Sibanda advised the farmers to remain hopeful and focused until a solution on the containment of the current pandemic is arrived at. -@tupeyo
