PREPARATIONS for the National Athletics of Zimbabwe (Naaz) interprovincial championships suffered a setback following Tuesday’s announcement tightening the lockdown and banning intercity travel. Naaz plans to hold its first event in the last weekend of September since all sporting activities were suspended at the onset of the lockdown in March. The event is set for White City Stadium in Bulawayo. Athletics is among sports that had been deemed as low risk by the Sports and Recreation Commission, and given the greenlight to resume activities until Tuesday’s announcement by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. However, the surge in Covid-19 cases forced the government tightening lockdown restrictions, which poses a concern for the Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) organising committee, as the event is set to have athletes from around the country. “We hope the ban will be lifted soon. With what is happening at the moment, it’s best to have such restrictions. But we believe it all shall be well. Surely, it’s tough, but we remain focused,” said Bab chairman Manuel Mpofu. “However, we will not stop our preparations. You never know what will happen since our proposed date is still a bit far. It’s a trick situation, but at the same time we say safety comes first,” he said.
