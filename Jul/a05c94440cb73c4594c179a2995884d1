THE Zimbabwe Humanitarian and Livelihoods Development Trust (ZHLDT) yesterday donated personal protective equipment (PPEs) and porridge to two health institutions in Matobo district to curb Covid-19. Mbembeswana Rural Health Centre Clinic and St Joseph’s Mission Rural Hospital each got masks, hand sanitizers, gloves and porridge for patients, expected to will last up to December this year. ZHLDT director Mr Norbert Dube said the organisation had sourced the PPEs to lessen the risk of the spread of Covid-19 in health care workers. He said the International Organisation for Migration funded the donation for the two institutions which have been designated as Covid-19 isolation centres. “We saw the need for Covid response because Covid-19 has affected food security, the health and livelihoods of the citizens and hence the importance of protecting the front-line workers in the communities who are at a high risk of contracting the virus,” said Mr Dube. “If the front-line workers especially at clinics are not protected, the communities would be left at risk hence the need for Covid response to support the front-line workers with PPEs.” Mr Dube said the porridge would give supplementary nutrition for the most vulnerable patients who were in isolation centres. He said ZHLDT was going to conduct awareness sessions in the different wards of the district with the Ministry of Health and Child Care on sanitation, hygiene and health behaviours. St Joseph’s Hospital Senior Nurse Sister Mary Ngwenya, thanked ZHLDT and said the donation had come at an opportune time. “As one of the isolation centres in the District, we had limitations when it comes to PPEs. We can now safely say we are ready for patients as we have received this donation. We are grateful even for the food that will help keep our clients nourished as we continue fighting Covi-19,” said Sr Ngwenya. @thamamoe
