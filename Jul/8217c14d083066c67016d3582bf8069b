The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter PROVINCIAL karate association chairperson Sensei Ndabezinhle Mazibuko has welcomed the move by the Zimbabwe Karate Union (ZKU) to introduce the sport in the mainstream education system. The ZKU is expected to submit a karate curriculum for consideration by the Sports and Recreation Commission by July 10. At the weekend karate style heads and branch chiefs submitted the syllabi of their styles to the mother association to enable the executive committee to draft an all styles encompassing Karate curriculum for submission to the SRC. Mazibuko said: “This is a move meant to have clear standards of operation by the various styles that are practised in the country. It’s a good move in the sense that the training should be structured and not haphazard. This will ensure kids are taught legitimate styles only with a registered syllabus.” He said the province was in the process of making consultations to come up with ways to ensure a safe return to the ring when the sport is given the greenlight to resume. “We have urged members to exercise patience and train in private while adhering to Covid-19 health protocols. The association has begun consultations to find the best ways to promote the sport after Convid-19,” he said. Karate has been declared a high risk sport by the SRC. During the course of the lockdown, Mazibuko has been helping athletes with online videos of exercises and workouts to ensure they maintain good shape at home. ZKU has also put in place a projects committee to help raise funds for teams on national duty. — @innocentskizoe
