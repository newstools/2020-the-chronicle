You still need to collect more awards for your collection.Musicians never grow old enough to stop making music because that’s what they live for – to heal people more than bandages could.” “It can’t be your last man. We still need your music, you gave us good music from Wajellwato Ayabulela. That was just a roundup of all the greatest hits you gave us.

Other fans reacted by advising the musician not to make premature decisions. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-505697" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/C9F18DB6-608B-4184-839C-0768404E3374.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/C9F18DB6-608B-4184-839C-0768404E3374.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/C9F18DB6-608B-4184-839C-0768404E3374-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
“Don’t say it’s your last album my guy. You don’t know how life happens. Look at Khuli Chana, he retired and saw it wasn’t working and tried to come back but the game wasn’t interested anymore. This is life,” commented one Thato Makhamba. Wrote Paul Likhale: “This could be your last album? I thought you were just taking warm ups.

Meanwhile, should he win the Sama song of the year award, Prince Kaybee pledged to give the award to Master KG who was not nominated for his hit, Jerusarema which features Nomcebo, despite it having performed very well last year. “If I win Song Of The Year this year at the Samas, I’m going to get that award edited to‪ Master KG Ft Nomcebo – Jerusalem. ‪That’s just my contribution to what they have achieved this year,” posted Prince Kaybee.
