The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE battle to control Hartsfield Ground saw Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) being embarrassed as it had to seek another venue to distribute food hampers after being locked out of the venue by the ousted Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board (BMRFB). ZRU was last Friday forced to distribute food hampers to national team players and coaches based in the Southern Region at Queens Sports Club. Not happy with ZRU’s decision to dissolve their board elected at the begging of the year only to be replaced by an interim committee, the ousted BMRFB officials have refused to recognise the union’s call and opted to take it head on. ZRU vice-president (southern region) Martin Shone said they will deal with “errant” members that almost ruined last week’s donation. ZRU gave hampers bought using the World Rugby Food and Medical Relief fund of €5 000. “That was a union event and it was supposed to be held at Hartsfield Ground, which is the home of rugby. Those guys from the previous board have been refusing with the keys for Hartsfield and I have on many occasions tried to get hold of former chairman Graig Change, but he doesn’t want to cooperate. We will deal with them accordingly,” said Shone. David Mhiribidi, the interim BMRFB chairman is hoping ZRU and the past board resolve the impasse soon. @ZililoR
