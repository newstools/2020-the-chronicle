The Chronicle WHILE tennis tours remain suspended, the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) says it has received 24 alerts of suspicious betting during the previous two months. Suspicious betting usually prompts further investigation and can indicate fixing activity or inside betting, though not necessarily. The alerts involved matches from various exhibitions taking place during the tour hiatus, though as is usual, the TIU did not, identify specific contests or events. These alerts were provided by betting companies that offered wagers on the matches, in accordance with their agreement with the TIU. ”Suspicious betting on tennis during the lockdown is seen as a firm indicator that corruptors remain active, and are likely to increase their focus on the sport when professional tennis resumes,” said a statement from the TIU, which had previously warned about potential problems with ‘unofficial’ events, which are not subject to the TIU’s supervision like tour events. It reiterated that given recent “reduced playing and earning opportunities and months of inactivity, the risks associated with betting-related corruption and doping violations” were higher. The TIU and anti-doping program have provided an education program for players during the suspension of competition to address this, it added, and a similar one will also be provided to officials. For comparison, tennis produced 101 alerts during 2019, a 43 percent decline, according to the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA). The ATP and WTA’s rules around players competing in exhibitions are suspended while there are no tour events. The TIU is jointly funded by the Grand Slams, ATP, WTA and ITF tours. – Tennis.com
