Highlanders are awaiting delivery of replica jerseys which the club hopes will help boost supplementary income. According to club sources, Highlanders designed their own shirts that were manufactured in China. Sources said the replica jerseys are expected in the country next month and will be sold at reasonable prices, with the club’s objective being to push volumes. Of late, Highlanders have been posting snippets of the designs on their official social media pages, asking followers for their opinions about the product. “The shipment was paid sometime back and they should be landing in the country from China next month. It’s something that is being kept under wraps and that is why you’ve been seeing some posts of shorts and socks on social media. The t-shirts will be revealed everything arrives,” said the source. Bulawayo Chiefs beat all local teams by setting up an online store to sell their merchandise. Highlanders are also said to be finalising on their online store, which shall be launched once merchandise arrives. The shipment of replicas puts to bed rumours linking Bosso with global sports kit maker Umbro. – @ZililoR
