POLICE in Matabeleland South Province have in just one week impounded 59 vehicles for violating lockdown regulations. Yesterday police working with the army increased patrols in Gwanda town with only workers providing essential services and residents seeking essential services being allowed into the city centre. Motorists and ordinary people who failed to give satisfactory reasons for their visit to the city centre were being turned back at roadblocks. Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson, Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele said 59 vehicles were impounded across the province in the past week for violating lockdown regulations. He said 4 715 people have been arrested in the province since the start of the lockdown on March 30 for violating Covid-19 regulations. “As police we are very much concerned that the country is witnessing an increase in Covid-19 cases. “We also notice that there is general laxity in adhering to lockdown regulations which is worrying. Police and the army have therefore intensified measures to ensure that people comply with Covid-19 regulations,” said Chief Insp Ndebele. He said in the past, the province had few people in isolation compared to those under quarantine but now it has more people in isolation which was a cause for concern. “We have increased patrols and roadblocks working together with members of the Zimbabwe National Army right across the province. The towns were now being flooded by people who were moving around aimlessly. We want to ensure that people go to town for essential services only. We are also conducting checks at shops to ensure they comply with the regulations in their operations. We have also received information on shebeens that have been opened and let them be warned,” said Chief Insp Ndebele. -@DubeMatutu
