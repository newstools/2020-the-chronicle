The Chronicle Former Arsenal boss Unai Emery is in talks to become the new head coach of Villarreal. Emery hasn’t managed since he was sacked by the Gunners in November last year and sees Villarreal as the perfect club to return to the game, as reported by Sky Sports. Villarreal, who finished in fifth place in LaLiga, are reportedly on the lookout for a new manager, with current coach Javier Calleja poised to depart. If he did take charge of Villarreal, Emery would again be involved in the Europa League, a competition he won three years in succession with Sevilla between 2014 and 2016. Emery previously managed Villarreal’s rivals Valencia between 2008 and 2012, while he also managed Lorca Deportiva and Almeria in his homeland. In 2018 Emery was appointed as Arsenal head coach shortly after his departure from Paris Saint-Germain. Although he oversaw a 22-game unbeaten run during his first season in charge, Arsenal endured much frustration under Emery’s guidance and were beaten 4-1 by Chelsea in the Europa League final. This season saw further problems for Emery, who was eventually dismissed after a run of seven games without a win. – Daily Mail
