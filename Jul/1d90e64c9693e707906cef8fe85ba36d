The Sungura genre which seems to be dying down will be brought back to life this Friday as a second clash between the genre’s artistes and Zimdancehall artistes has been organised. Sulumani “Sulu” Chimbetu and Peter “Young Igwe” Moyo will lock horns with Enzo Ishall and Soul Jah Love during the Nash TV Friday Night Live show. Dubbed ‘Round 2 Dancehall vs Sungura’, the virtual show will be shown on Nash TV Facebook and YouTube pages from 9:30PM with Merciless and Shugeta being the MCs. Sulu and the Young Iwe who outshone their dancehall counterparts, Kinnah and Bazooka during the first round of the battle in May will be looking to hold on to the battle’s cup. Butterphly Phunk who hosts the Friday Night Live said the audience will once again serve as the adjudication panel. “The battle began in May and Sungura fellas won the first leg after the audience voted. The audience will continue to judge the battle and can make their votes in the comments section. “The idea behind the battle is to unpack the feud between sungura and dancehall and see which genre lives to see the next day,” said Butterphly Phunk. She added that the battle is set to go on for the coming shows. @mthabisi_mthire
