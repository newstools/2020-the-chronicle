Another up-and-coming South Africa-based Zimbabwean musician, Mthandazi Nyathi has composed a song which tackles the rampant lockdown domestic violence cases. The trap soul jam titled Ng’yakhala is due to be released in the coming weeks. Hailing from rural Manama in Gwanda and using the stage name Intercessor, the young artiste said the single which was produced by P Brian at Juicy Fam studios in South Africa will be available for download on online music platforms. “The song seeks to urge men to shun from abusing and killing women because they are the pillar of our lives. There is need to honour the efforts made by women in ensuring homes are stable. “I composed the song after seeing how domestic violence cases of men abusing and also women abusing men are on the rise as most couples are spending more time together than before due to the lockdown,” said Intercessor. He said after the launch of Ng’yakhala, he will drop another single titled Inde Lendlela which will feature Bulawayo musician Leslie Luwizhi Kampila. Intercessor has one album under his belt titled Ngisemathandweni which was released last year in September. @mthabisi_mthire
