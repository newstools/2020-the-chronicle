South Africa-based comedian Nceku has urged fellow artistes to adapt to the new ways of doing business as the world has been forced to go digital due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The arts industry has been largely affected by the pandemic, as most artistes relied on the public to make money either through physically selling their wares or staging shows at venues. But now, since they can no longer do so due to the restrictions on physical interaction, some artistes who relied solely on their art talent, are finding the going tough as they are holed up at their homes with no source of income. Speaking through his manager, Wisdom Nyathi, Nceku who was part of a listening session of former Joyous Celebration member, Ayanda Shange’s album this past weekend, said it is high time that musicians and all their counterparts fight to overcome poverty. “As artistes, this is the time to find side things to do, sell or enterprise in order to supplement your income. Hunger knows no celebrity and therefore, this moment needs prayer as it’s a season where one should know where they stand,” said Nceku. With online shows gaining momentum, Nceku said gospel artistes must not wait to be invited to perform, but instead, host their own if they are to remain relevant. “Gospel artistes should adapt to the changes. The digital space is taking over. They should research new ways of showcasing their craft or ministry, learn, practice and sharpen their skills. “The digital space requires quality and this could be achieved by writing more spirit-filled and relevant songs for such a time,” said Nceku. The award-winning comedian, after realising that no joke can change the mood for some who are highly stressed and depressed because of the pandemic, recently started offering counselling services on his social media platforms through established psychologists/counsellors. @mthabisi_mthire
