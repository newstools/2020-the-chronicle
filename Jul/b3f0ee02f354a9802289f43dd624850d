PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) clubs will use this weekend’s meeting with the Zifa executive committee to push for the Fifa/Caf Covid-19 relief fund to be paid in forex. All 18 clubs chairpersons have been invited to an indaba, which will touch on a number of football issues, including the plight of topflight clubs during the lockdown period. This is the first time outside congress that the PSL governors and the Zifa executive are meeting to discuss the state of football in the country in the wake of the paralysis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The association announced last week that it had set aside a $110.5 million Covid-19 relief package for the resumption of football, which has been hit hard by the lockdown. This translates to about US$1.7 million using the latest official forex auction rate. The money is part of the US$1.8 million the association received from Fifa and Caf to assist clubs survive adverse effects of the pandemic. The PSL will get the biggest chunk after it was allocated about $25.7 million (US$390 197). Each of the 18 topflight clubs will get an equivalent of about US$5 000, with the bulk of the money funding Covid-19 tests for players and staff. PSL governors have reportedly tasked the league chairman Farai Jere, who represents them in the Zifa executive, to tell the association that they want the relief funds in foreign currency. – @ZililoR
