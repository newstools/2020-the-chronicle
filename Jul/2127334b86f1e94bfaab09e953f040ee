THE wife to one of the founding members of the Twelve Apostolic Church, Zale Ndlovu (Nee Dube), who died last Thursday, has since been buried in Plumtree. She was 88. The late Ndlovu, who was one of the country’s oldest serving members, is survived by nine children and many grandchildren. Reverend Physant Kikkins said the late Ndlovu Was married to one of the founding members of the church and had served the church sincerely. “She was a member of the church formed by her her husband and other members based in South Africa,” said Rev Kikins. The late Ndlovu who has been described by many as a humble and respected Christian, had been ill for a long time. Rev Kikins said the void left by Ndlovu will be difficult to fill. Renowned Plumtree businessman Mr Michael Golden Sibanda echoed the same sentiments saying: “Ndlovu shaped the lives of many people in Plumtree. “Many of us were nurtured by her. She had a great influence in shaping our lives and we are what we are today because of her,” said Mr Sibanda.
