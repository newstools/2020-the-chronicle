TEN countries have confirmed their participation in the fourth edition of the Southern Africa 3X3 Under-18 basketball tournament to be held in Bulawayo in December. The competition will run from December 3-6. Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) president Joe Mujuru said regional powerhouses Angola and Mozambique will not be part of the competition, leaving host nation Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa and Indian Ocean islanders Madagascar and Seychelles to battle it out at the event. “Ten countries have responded to invitations sent to their federations that they will be coming to Zimbabwe for the December 3X3 Southern Africa Under-18 basketball tournament. Early confirmation gives us as the host nation adequate time to plan so that we host a successful event,” said Mujuru. Zimbabwe won the Under-18 competition dubbed “Three Lions 3X3 Southern Cup” held in Botswana last year. @ZililoR.
