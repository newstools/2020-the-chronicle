The Flamerz Entertainment (TFE), a recording studio in Bulawayo, is determined to put the city’s music out there and make a name for themselves in the process after signing “big” artistes. Some have already said this studio is the next best thing after Harare’s Chillspot Records which continues to churn out artistes from the capital who go on to become forces to reckon with. Formed barely a year ago, the recording studio has worked with Mzoe 7, Novuyo Seagirl, Asaph, Rockie doulb and Hairo G from USA. The studio is run by a youthful trio of Silent Chikowore (Dr Saizar), Tanaka Chimeta (Tha Dawg) and Promise Chirodzero (Real Shona). Dr Saizar, TFE manager said the atmosphere and vibe surrounding their studio was a good indicator that Bulawayo is fast becoming the next Chillspot. “The Flamerz Entertainment is a vibe in its most raw form. As TFE, we’ve managed to create an environment that makes artistes comfortable while working. It’s also a centre where people in the industry meet, network, discuss and try to find solutions to the current problems they’re facing,” he said. The manager said what sets them apart from the rest is the vibe they have created which makes the artistes relax and feel at home while producing good music. “Our motto is ‘it’s not just about making quality music, it’s about the experience of making it’,” he said. Testimony to the envisioned ambitious status, Dr Saizar said is the list of local and international artistes they have worked with. “We also have songs that are doing well on our local radio stations and TV. For now, we’re working with a new artiste called Skai, an Afro-pop artist among many others.” Some of the songs they have produced include Asambeni by Mzoe 7, Ngeke bazokholwa by Hairo G, Chimoto by Tha dawg and Monati fela by Roki Doulb ft Asaph and Vic Jita.
