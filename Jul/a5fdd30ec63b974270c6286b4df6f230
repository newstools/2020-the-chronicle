THE inaugural Mr Teen Zimbabwe pageant will be held virtually on Saturday where finalists drawn from around the country, will battle for the title. Five finalists have been shortlisted to contest and these are Bulawayo’s Ben Dube (15), Taonashe Gwirai (18), Mthokozisi Magaisa (18), Zibusiso Ngwenya (18) and Harare’s Clint Kugowa (18). Others who participated in the contest were Blessing Manyara (19), Muhammad Ameer Samsodien (16), Shingai Murisi (16), Tavonga Muwani (18) and Kelvin Mavawani (18). The pageant which is about rekindling the boy child’s confidence on the ramp will be streamed live as from 7pm on the event’s Mr Zimbabwe Teen Instagram page. The winner is set to walk away with $1 500 with $900 for first-runner-up and $500 for the second runner-up. Speaking from Harare, pageant founder, Ishmael Murangandi who is also a model said: “The boy child is slowly losing confidence. We were brought up in a patriarchal society and we believe the boy child has to be confident and brave. Our boys have lost that. The empowered girl child has taken over dominance and in order to create balance, I came up with the pageant. “Our competition started with only three provinces responding to the call – Bulawayo, Harare and Mutare. They were given assignments and we were looking at things like punctuality, creativity and humility. From the challenges, five were selected from the top 10 for the final ceremony with four special awards set to be presented to the top 10 finalists.” The five are going to be adjudicated through a virtual process that will see judges from three countries decide their fate. These are Zimbabweans Byron Mulinga (Former Mr Zimbabwe), Patience Chigwaza and Lungile Mathe, Ghanaian Fred Bruno and Nigerian David Uyo. – @mthabisi_mthire.
