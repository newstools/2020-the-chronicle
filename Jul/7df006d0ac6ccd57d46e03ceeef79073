THE sharp increase in Covid-19 infections in the country has forced the Gwanda Tennis Academy to freeze all training activities despite having the licence to operate under strict measures. In an effort to guarantee the safety of players, the academy has seen it fit to call off sessions until the situation subsides. The academy’s tournament director Archbald Dungeni said players will not be able to take to the court anytime soon. “The surge in new cases favour a cautious approach at the moment. We have also been in touch with other clubs to share notes and at the moment we all agree the safety and health of our members comes first. We had started taking small numbers through their paces, but as of last week we have stopped all activity, while  awaiting a decline in positive stats,” said Dungeni. “These are trying times and hopefully we can be back on the courts within six months. We believe this is just a bump in the road and great times still lie ahead,” he said. The Covid-19 lockdown crisis has already resulted in postponement of the annual Gwanda Junior Invitational Tennis Tournament, which had become a regular feature on the tennis calendar.
