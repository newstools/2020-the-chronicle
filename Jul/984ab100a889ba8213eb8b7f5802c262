ZIMBABWE Rugby Union (ZRU) is embarking on a rebuilding exercise that will see fresh ideas being injected by new coaches that will be appointed during the course of the year. The union terminated contracts for all national teams’ coaching staff, with only the exception of Brandon Dawson, who was appointed to the Sables last year with the mandate of leading Zimbabwe’s 2023 World Cup campaign. Clarifying the move to terminate contracts for the men’s and women’s national team sides that include the Cheetahs, Lady Cheetahs, Lady Sables, Goshawks, Zimbabwe Rugby Academy and all junior teams, ZRU president Aaron Jani said cancelation of activities for the year due to Covid-19 forced them to embark on a rebuilding exercise. “We don’t have a uniform coaching style or ethos that will promote common values and techniques. As a result, we do not have continuity and don’t share common values. We have some coaches who have failed to deliver for various reasons. There are some technical teams that are not a natural fit leading to conflict and strife. There are also some discipline issues in some sections. We educated and trained a lot of coaches in the last few years and we believe all coaches must get a chance at national duty deployment,” said Jani. – @ZililoR
