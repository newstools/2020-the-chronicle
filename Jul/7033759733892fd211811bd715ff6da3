We will start off from Season one up to Season two of MTV Shuga Down South, so as to allow the viewers to easily follow the storyline,” said Gilmore Tee. He said he hoped the show would help start conversations around HIV/Aids and teenage pregnancy. “We are all affected by HIV/Aids, teenage pregnancy, drug abuse and Sexual Reproductive Health and we need to start openly having conversations. “MTV Shuga, gives that platform to create conversations as it is an edutainment drama series. I hope the Zimbabwean viewers will enjoy the show and engage with us on social media platforms,” said Gilmore Tee. He said judging by how the show was well received on during the screenings at universities in Zimbabwe, it was important that the youth’s voices are heard. “This year’s screenings at NUST and the University of Zimbabwe, were extremely well received, with a lot of engagement from students, especially on Sexual Reproductive Health, HIV, Teenage pregnancies, drugs and child abuse in our communities. It was important to hear youths share these stories and also it is vital for us to find solutions to such issues,” said Gilmore Tee.
