SOUTH African-based pugilist Elvis Moyo has come to the rescue of a financially challenged fan that bought his framed gloves and picture for his first Extreme Fighting Championship (EFC) gig by buying back the priceless portrait. Moyo, who ventured into cage fighting in 2014, winning his first match against Sors Grobelaarsl in 2014, framed the gloves he used for his maiden fight and put it on sale. One of the fans who bought the frame indicated last week that she had hit hard times and was selling the framed gloves. Moyo bought them from the lady and says he will present it to one of the people who have been supportive of his career. “Apparently a fan bought it in 2014 when I started my EFC career. A friend of mine saw an advert that she was selling the collector’s item because she is broke and wanted to make ends meet as she was affected by the Covid-19 lockdown. Because I know things are hard, I decided to buy it back for the amount we agreed on just to support her. You never know what situation she is in, but at least I know I did the right thing. I have it at home. I’m looking to give it to someone. There are many people that have assisted me and I want to give it to someone as a gift,” said Moyo. Moyo has 13 EFC fights under his belt, winning seven and losing six. – @ZililoR
