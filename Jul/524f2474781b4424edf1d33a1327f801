Kwekwe City councillors have passed a resolution to appoint Dr Lucia Mnkandla as substantive Town Clerk. Dr Mnkandla, a long serving Chamber Secretary   has been acting TC for the mining town since the retirement of Emmanuel Musara in December 2017. Kwekwe Mayor, Councillor Angeline Kasipo, confirmed the development in an interview. “As council we have recommended that Dr Mnkandla be appointed substantive Town Clerk. We made the recommendation as a council and we have since submitted our recommendation to Government and we await the outcome,” said Cllr Kasipo. She said Dr Mnkandla, who has been serving the city for more than a decade, was a tried and tested cadre who has a proven track record on the job. “We decided to go for the devil we know. Dr Mnkandla has been there with us and we have seen what she is capable of doing so we simply decided to stick to her rather than looking for someone new,” said Cllr Kasipo. She said Dr Mnkandla has turned around the fortunes of the city since she started acting. Interviews for the post were conducted last year and they saw big names throwing their names into the ring to try and land the top post. Law Society of Zimbabwe President who is former Kwekwe Chamber Secretary, Edward Mapara, Chitungwiza Director of Housing Mrs Hazel Sithole and Gweru assistant Finance Director Mr Michael Verenga are some of the big names who went through the interviews.
