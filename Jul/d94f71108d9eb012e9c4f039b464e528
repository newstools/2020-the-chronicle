DISCO queen Patricia Majalisa will be buried in her Eastern Cape township of Mdantsane in South Africa tomorrow with her family saying they are grateful for the love and support they have received from her fans in Zimbabwe. Majalisa died of liver failure last week Thursday at Helen Joseph’s Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. Her manager DJ Oska said: “We’ve received monies from fans in Botswana and Namibia with fans in Zimbabwe showing love and support.” He said the funeral will be streamed live on YouTube and East London’s Buffalo City Metro Television (BCM TV) station. “Patricia will be laid to rest in Mdantsane Township in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. A link will be circulated for everyone to access the broadcast. BCM TV in East London will also cover the event with people set to follow the funeral through a link that will be shared on her Facebook page and other various social media sites.” Born on February 15, 1967, Majalisa was a member of Splash, a group founded by Dan Tshanda who died last year. She rose to fame after the launch of her debut solo album, Cool Down, in 1986. Her next two albums, Gimba and Witchdoctor, sold in excess of 50 000, earning the coveted platinum status.
