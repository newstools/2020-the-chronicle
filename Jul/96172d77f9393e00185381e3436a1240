When Jesus says yes, nobody can say no. This rings true for Nkayi–based Maskandi musician, Clopas Sikhosana who seems to be in luck as he continues to penetrate the virtual world through his video clips. Having been discovered a few months back through a comic video clip where he was singing about the Covid-19 pandemic, Sikhosana of the ngizokulimaza ngebeat fame,was invited to Bulawayo by well-wishers, to record an album. During that time, he was interviewed by Cite Zimbabwe journalist, Zenzele Ndebele in what turned out to be a hilarious clip.  At the beginning of the interview, Ndebele asked: “Akusitshele, uSikhosana ngubani” with the hope to hear about Sikhosana’s life, to which Sikhosana unconsciously responded: “USikhosana yimi.” Many found this legendary response to be hilarious and it soon made its way onto the Internet as a meme. The clip seems to have crossed over to South Africa as it definitely made Uzalo actress, Mangcobo’s (real name Dawn Thandeka King) day as she shared it on her Instagram page which has 1,5 million followers on Wednesday. Her followers also found the clip funny with most describing Sikhosana as hilarious. Some started inquiring about Sikhosana with local followers thronging Mangcobo’s page to share more information about the musician. Within four hours, the video clip had garnered over 6 000 views. A very humble man, Sikhosana seems to be in luck as the Internet is taking him places he never imagined.
