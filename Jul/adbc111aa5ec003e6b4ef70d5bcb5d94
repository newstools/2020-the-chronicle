ACTOR-cum-singer Linda ‘Lee McHoney’ Nyauchi popularly referred to as Mai Noku because of her role on popular drama, Wadiwa Wepa Moyo, is rumoured to be pregnant. Speculation arose after an image of the artiste, pictured with Madlela Skhobokhobo, clad in a baggy hoodie was circulated on social media last week. Known for her seductive poses, Lee McHoney, a mother of one, was captured wearing a baggy hoodie, which fans concluded she wore to cover up a baby bump. McHoney laughed off the rumours, saying she was not pregnant. “Lol. I’m not pregnant. Even if I was, I wouldn’t want it to be made public,” she told Chronicle Showbiz. The coming of a new life into the world is God’s blessing and only time will tell as the artiste could be planning to surprise fans, like American female rapper Nicki Minaj, who recently flaunted her pregnancy pictures on social media. @mthabisi_mthire
