THERE is a need to protect whistleblowers as Government enacts the proposed law to deal with cyber-crimes, residents told Members of Parliament during public hearings in Bulawayo and Gwanda. The Senate Thematic Committee on Peace and Security and the National Assembly’s portfolio Committee on ICT, Postal and Courier Services as well as the portfolio Committee on Media, Information and Broadcasting Services conducted joint public hearings on the Cyber-Crimes Bill in Gwanda yesterday and were in Bulawayo on Monday . The Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill seeks to among other things address cyber-crimes by enabling the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) to establish a cyber security centre.Potraz will be the principal advisor to Government on issues of data collection, storage, processing, security and transmission. New criminal offences over misuse of data or information technology such as inciting violence, threatening harm, publishing sexual details of friends and family and a raft of similar undesirable activity will be established through amendments and additions to the Criminal Code. The Bill seeks to consolidate cyber-related offences and provide for data protection with due regard to the Declaration of Rights under the Constitution and the public and national interest. Residents said during the hearings that the Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill is necessary to address lawlessness resulting from the use of technology which was rampant in the country. They also called for the bill to specify how whistle blowers will be protected. Speaking during yesterday’s meeting Gwanda resident, Mr Rido Mpofu said an economic warfare was being waged against the country through misuse of data and information. “There is also rampant lawlessness in the use of technology in the country. There are illegal digital transfers of money which are taking place. Some people are getting richer and richer by manipulating technology while others are getting poorer and poorer,” he said. Mr Mpofu said the country was under threat from developed countries which were monitoring and interfering in the affairs of the nation through satellites. “While Government is pushing this bill, there is a need to look into strategies to protect the people from interference from foreign countries. Most communication systems are being monitored globally using satellites. How do we control this and curb interference from other countries? There is a need for Government to monitor satellites and block other nations from accessing some of our affairs and issues. We need cyber security and data protection against these nations,” he said. Ms Linda Mpofu said there is need for the bill to be split into two. She said there was need for a Cyber Security bill and a Data Protection Bill. She said there was need for the bill to be specific on how whistle blowers will be protected as it is silent on the issue. Mr Albert Ncube said there was need for the cyber security centre and data protection authority to report to Parliament and not a Minister as stated in the bill in order to ensure the two bodies remain objective. Mr Malachi Nkomo said the bill was crucial as it would ensure rights of people were not violated. <img class="wp-image-503329 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mr-Malachi-Nkomo-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mr-Malachi-Nkomo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mr-Malachi-Nkomo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Malachi Nkomo On Monday, the committees conducted two hearings in Luveve and Pumula South suburbs in Bulawayo. During dabate residents expressed mixed views on the proposed Bill. “I do not support this bill because it will invade my privacy, I do not want anyone following information in my phone,” said Mr Kwanele Mbambo who did not specify where he lives. Another Bulawayo resident Mr Tendai Magonya said the Bill will guard against plagiarism and ‘stealing’ information generated by other people. “I am a scholar and I have had my information compromised, you are writing a university project and the next thing 50 people already have the information. Those people are causing an injustice to me in that regard. I want this bill to become law to protect people from those who steal and plagiarize information,” he said. Mr Magonya however said he was against Potraz running the show. “Let us have a body that will report to Parliament and not to the Minister. We should limit the number of people having access to our information,” he said. Mr Crispen Ndlovu said the proposed law will prevent the public from voicing their concerns with the Government. “We will be limited from debating issues that concern us as citizens fearing arrests. Why should anyone or the Government be interested in our information in a free country, our freedom of speech is under attack,” said Mr Ndlovu. Sikhethokuhle Ndlovu from Magwegwe West said the Bill will protect children. “I support the bill, those against it are the ones doing illegal things, there must be a limit to what people share especially on social networks like WhatsApp. People spreading wrong information on social media must be known and punished if need be. As a parent I want my children to be protected and I believe this bill will address my concerns,” she said. Another resident from Old Pumula Mr Master Khanye said he does not support the creation of a data storage centre. “My right will be taken away under the proposed law. We were enjoying freedom of speech but this bill seeks to reverse that. We all have secrets that we share on our cellphones and to have authorities do as they please with my information is not acceptable,” he said. In an interview with Chronicle after hearings in Pumula South, Dr David Parirenyatwa who was chairing the meeting, said it is very important for the public to be availed with copies of bills before hearings are conducted. “There is no alternative to letting people know in advance and having people access the bill in its written form but I know that these days people are giving excuses that because of Covid 19 they are no longer providing handouts, but clearly that is what is needed for people to articulate the bill before so that when we come they are already familiar with the bills. This is not being done and I urge Parliament to inform people well inadvance of these public hearings,” he said. Commenting on the public engagements during the two meetings in Bulawayo, Dr Parirenyatwa said some members of the public were just saying they support or do not support the bill without giving reasons which means they did not have adequate information.
