UNITED Kingdom-based musician Sisasenkosi ‘Sisa Senkosi’ Mkandla has rolled out a competition to search for a talented dancer or singer that will see the winner walking away with US$100 for their own purpose and US$50 which they will donate to a charity or cause of their choice. The competition is open to everyone worldwide and will see the competitors imitating either by singing or dancing, her wedding song titled Ngiyavuma I Do. Speaking from her UK base, Sisa Senkosi said interested participants should send to her Facebook page, a 30-second video of them singing or dancing to the song which features Moses Ngwenya and Platform One. The video with most likes is the one which will determine the winner. “The challenge is for a week and ends on July 21 with US$100 up for grabs plus US$50 meant for charity. The winner will be announced on July 25,” said Sisa Senkosi. The soft-spoken musician said the competition was being run to observe the wedding period. “This competition was motivated by the fact that we’re getting into the wedding season where the song would have been played, but due to the lockdown, it’s impossible. “This is a way of having fun and my way of thanking everyone who has supported the song since its release,” said Sisa Senkosi. Apart from this initiative, the artiste once came to the rescue of fellow artistes in Bulawayo after she donated mealie meal through her Isisa Senkosi Helping Hands Foundation to assist them during the lockdown.
