The Chronicle IT has been two weeks since SuperSport United resumed training and coach Kaitano Tembo has spoken about the emotion he experienced since his return. The Tshwane outfit was one of the first Absa Premiership teams deemed Covid-19 compliant and returned to training on July 5. SuperSport have had their full complement of players available for training although they are split into small groups who have different training schedules. Speaking to the club’s official website, Tembo revealed that it was an emotional experience to be with his players once again. The Zimbabwean also shared why he was proud of his squad. “It was very emotional seeing the guys for the first time after three months and you could see the smiles and the excitement on the faces of the guys. It showed that we had really missed each other and also missed what we really enjoy doing and that’s playing football. “The focal point of our first week was the fitness condition of our players which meant we had to go through a battery of tests and then start building the fitness levels gradually. “The players had training programmes during isolation and I’m very proud of the players for being very professional in terms of following their routine and that showed character and mental strength,” Tembo said. —Soccer Laduma
