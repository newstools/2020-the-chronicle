RENOWNED football agents George Deda and Gibson Mahachi are among five people that have been registered by Zifa as the country’s only recognised player intermediaries. Mahachi, who has strong links with South African teams, has facilitated moves for players such as Teenage Hadebe when he moved to Kaizer Chiefs from Chicken Inn, SuperSport United’s Evans Rusike as well as former Chippa United coach Norman Mapeza. Deda has been behind Zimbabwean players’ moves to Zambia, Tanzania and most recently to West Africa where Tafadzwa Kutinyu plays for Horoya in Guinea. The other agents that Zifa registered are Gerald Maguranyanga, Colin Zilali and Charles Jones. In a statement, Zifa said: “Following the reform of the players’ agents system to the efficient and transparent intermediary system by the Federation of International Football Associations (Fifa), the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) has adopted the new approach.” – @ZililoR
