ZIFA Southern Region Division One side and Bosso 90 rivals Ajax Hotspurs have contributed towards the Highlanders’ debt clearance campaign being spearheaded by South African-based member Nodumo Nyathi. In a show of solidarity and the Bulawayo giants’ pulling influence, the Mpopoma-based outfit, this week joined other concerned Bosso members and sympathisers by throwing in what they can afford to totally eradicate the Highlanders legacy debt that previously stood at $862 868. But through the efforts of Nyathi, contributions of $400 000 have been raised and the debt is now less than $500 000. Nyathi remains confident that Amahlolanyama will be debt-free by the end of this month. Nyathi posted the Ajax Hotspurs contribution on Facebook. Ajax Hotspurs has over the past few years channelled a number of players to the Highlanders’ first team, with star defender Peter “21 Questions” Muduhwa among the prominent ones. “There is nothing as touching as this. Siphambaniso Dube and Ajax Hotspurs are saying Highlanders FC must be debt free,” wrote Nyathi. Dube is the Ajax Hotspurs’ majority shareholder and a Highlanders card carrying member. According to Highlanders spokesperson Ronald Moyo, the money that has been raised through Nyathi’s initiative has been channelled towards paying about 25 former players and some coaches.
