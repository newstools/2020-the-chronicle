We hope one day these youngsters will excel beyond the league that they will play in. Our wish is that one day Bulawayo City FC will send its scouts to look for talent at Falakhe FC when games resume after the Covid-19 pandemic.” Ward 27 councillor Siboniso Khumalo, who is also Bulawayo City FC board chairman, urged residents to support the team morally and physically and support the youngsters whenever they are playing. “It’s good to see that Falakhe is giving back to the community through soccer.

The challenge I’m giving to youngsters is that grab this opportunity and strive to reach greatness and earn a livelihood through soccer,” Khumalo said.
