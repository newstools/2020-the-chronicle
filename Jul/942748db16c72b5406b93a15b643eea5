NEWLY appointed Street Set FC chairperson Nompumelelo Damba says her immediate goal is to lure potential sponsors for the women’s side. Street Set played in the Ladies Amateur Football Association last year and had set their sights on joining the Zifa Bulawayo Division One League this year before sporting activities were suspended due to the Covid-19 enforced lockdown. “So far l have appointed new executive members that are going to be closely working with me. Nothing much has happened as we are waiting for the situation to normalise,” said Damba. “You can expect a lot from the new executive as we are going to work hard to transform the image of Street Set and the women’s game in general. We will also put in place new measures to attract businesspeople to sponsor the team and invest in women’s football,” she said. Mbekezeli Dino Sibanda has been appointed treasurer in the new executive, with Gugulethu Ncube coming in as secretary. Damba is passionate about sport, having played girls’ football and volleyball in secondary school. “I am a feminist who believes in equality for all people regardless of their gender or sexuality. I’m a final year student in Journalism and Media Studies at Nust and it is feminism that pushed me to choose this career path because l saw an opportunity to fight for women’s emancipation through journalism and film making,” she said. – @innocentskizoe
