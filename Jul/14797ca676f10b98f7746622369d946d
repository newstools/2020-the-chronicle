THE Judicial Service Commission (JSC) has started a head-count of its staff countrywide to establish the size of its workforce. The audit is aimed at eliminating ghost workers in both the JSC and Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. JSC last month celebrated 10 years of existence following its complete separation from the Ministry and is carrying out the audit to ensure no Ministry staff are in the commission’s books. Four teams have been set up to carry out the weeklong exercise which started on Monday and will see the teams visiting the JSC’s 69 stations countrywide. In an interview at the Victoria Falls Magistrates’ Courts on Tuesday, JSC spokesperson Ms Rumbidzai Takawira said the exercise will be completed tomorrow. “As the Judicial Service Commission, we have taken it upon ourselves to ensure that we deal with the issue ghost workers. Government as a whole is trying to deal with the issue to make sure it is not paying people who are not there,” said Ms Takawira. The team that was in Victoria Falls is visiting all stations in Matabeleland region. After Victoria Falls it headed for Binga and was expected in Hwange yesterday before moving to Lupane and Tsholotsho. – @ncubeleon
