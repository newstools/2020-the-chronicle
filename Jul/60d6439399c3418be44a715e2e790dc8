With lockdown measures having been tightened last week following a rise in local Covid-19 transmissions, chances of weddings being held anytime soon have been thrown out of the window as the country is grappling with the pandemic. Since March this year, wedding service providers have been out of business as weddings were among the first events to be suspended as part of efforts to contain the virus by limiting human interaction. Among those whose business has been affected is Fusion Media Group (FMG) from Bulawayo which specialises in photography and videography, especially for weddings. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-505927" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/050A6844-926D-457A-965A-021F90A2D448.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/050A6844-926D-457A-965A-021F90A2D448.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/050A6844-926D-457A-965A-021F90A2D448-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Taking to their Facebook fan page on Wednesday afternoon, FMG admitted that they miss providing their services at weddings. To keep themselves occupied, they said they want to conduct a shoot, free of charge for a couple. As such, they are looking for an interesting couple to work with. “We really miss shooting weddings so we are looking for a couple to work with for a collaboration shoot (P.S no payment needed). The couple has to be fun, open to creativity, either married or not married and have an ok social media following,” posted FMG. To be considered for the shoot, the couple has to send their images to FMG on a number that is on their Facebook page. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-505929" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/8B4A1150-6C7A-4698-9651-CF356548806A.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/8B4A1150-6C7A-4698-9651-CF356548806A.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/8B4A1150-6C7A-4698-9651-CF356548806A-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The media company went on to invite service providers who want to partner them for the shoot including Decor people, Wedding gowns, Men’s Suits, Hair Stylist and Makeupartist. Commenting on this initiative which is part of FMG’s efforts to keep people entertained during the lockdown, people said they were looking forward to seeing image of the couples who will be shortlisted for the shoot as they will be posted on FMG’s Facebook page. “This is great news, looking forward to the fun,” commented one Tapiwa Silumbu. In terms of trying to keep people entertained during the lockdown, FMG has been on top of the situation as they have been hosting what they termed FMG live sessions on their Facebook page. These virtual shows have not only provided entertainment, but promoted a lot of artistes from Bulawayo as they have been exposed to wider virtual audiences.
