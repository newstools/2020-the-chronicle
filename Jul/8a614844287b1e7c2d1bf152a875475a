Arts stable, Moyoxide Ideations through its community engagement initiatives, wants to revive the Pantsula dance genre through a dance challenge for Victory Siyanqoba’s song, Ama2000, which they have launched. Dubbed the Ama2000 Pantsula dance video competition, the competition which ends on August 15 will see the ultimate winner bagging R500. Second placed and third placed dancers will take home R350 and R200 respectively. The winners will be announced on August 31. To participate, individuals or groups must record 90 second video clips dancing to the song and send it by WhatsApp to a number that will be shared by competition organisers on their social media pages. Executive Director of Moyoxide Ideations and Victory Siyanqoba, Desire Moyo aka Moyoxide said the competition is meant to create a buzz of the song as dance challenges are now the in-thing as shown by the popularity of Jah Prayzah’s Donhodzo dance challenge and Master KG’s Jerusalema hit. “We’re doing a promotion of our song Ama2000 which is a call to revive the Pantsula dance genre while also exposing local dance talent. It is also our way to revive the arts which have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. We want to keep the industry alive by ensuring people participate in arts activities while on lockdown,” said Moyoxide. “The lockdown has unearthed people’s hidden talents and we want to help them unearth their dance talent.” Moyoxide said the top 20 videos will be posted on the Moyoxide Ideations and Victory Siyanqoba Facebook pages with the one that gets the most votes being crowned the winner. As the song which was composed by Moyoxide and performed by Victory Siyanqoba had its music video recording plans disrupted by the pandemic, there are chances that clips from the challenge will be used for the ultimate video of the song which was released in March. – @mthabisi_mthire.
