Musician Mzoe 7 has delved into the world of Amapiano by releasing a track titled Asambeni that is an encouragement to people not to be demoralised in life. Amapiano is a style of house music that emerged in the townships of Pretoria, South Africa in 2016. It is a sophisticated hybrid of deep house, jazz and lounge music that blew up to become an anthemic part of South Africa’s house scene last year following key releases from popular artistes like Samthing Soweto and Moonchild Sanelly. Riding on the success of the genre, Mzoe 7 has tried his hand on the beat with his song now available on his YouTube channel. Mzoe 7 said Asambeni which means exodus is a jovial song that can appeal to anyone. “The song is an encouragement to say no matter what we’ve been through, let’s not be demoralised in life. Let’s keep going, alone you can go fast, but together, we can go far hence the saying Asambeni,” said Mzoe 7. The song is a fusion of Amapiano and Afro music with a live element of guitar and saxophone. DJ PressureZw from Gweru made the beat, with Vuyi playing the saxophone and Shekinah on lead guitar. The song was recorded at Flamers Studios in Bulawayo and mixed and mastered by Hitkid. Mzoe 7 said the new song shows his growth in music. “I’m growing musically and people should expect more live elements in my songs going forward,” he said. He said the song is a build up to his forthcoming album, United Country of Africa to be released later on this year.
