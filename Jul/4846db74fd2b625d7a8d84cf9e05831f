Dressed in cordial apparel, the artiste has reminded many of her yesteryear days. While at it, she has been inspiring plus size women to be happy about their bodies regardless of size. In an interview, Sandy said she is just an inch away from her desired body. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-505038" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/F133BC90-8882-403C-A628-8EDCB0579AC5.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/F133BC90-8882-403C-A628-8EDCB0579AC5.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/F133BC90-8882-403C-A628-8EDCB0579AC5-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
“The pictures alone, tell the whole story. I’m heading in the right direction, sekusele kancane nje. “This is a clear example of working hard (in staying fit) and there’s no excuse for women and everyone out there to neglect their bodies. If old European people are still fit, why can’t we do the same,” the always jovial Sandy quizzed. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-505040" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/AE25077C-446C-4A33-BD06-09685B98414B.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/AE25077C-446C-4A33-BD06-09685B98414B.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/AE25077C-446C-4A33-BD06-09685B98414B-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
