Gweru City Council’s isolation hospital, which was identified as the district’s Covid-19 referral centre, has started admitting patients following the completion of renovations. The 26-bed isolation hospital, which had become an eyesore due to years of neglect, got a major facelift courtesy of the Gweru business community. Gweru district Covid-19 task force chairperson, Dr Shakespeare Mureyani, yesterday said the isolation centre already had five patients. “We have started admitting Covid-19 patients at the institution and we now have patients,” he said. Dr Mureyani said the isolation hospital handled the delivery of an expecting woman who was a Covid-19 patient. “The woman delivered the baby about two months ago,” he said. “We have a very dedicated team of front-line staff at the hospital who are looking after those Covid-19 patients.” Dr Mureyani said the district Covid-19 taskforce was continuing to solicit for resources to use at the isolation hospital, especially personal protective clothing (PPE) for the front line staff. Gweru city’s director for Health Services, Mr Sam Sekenhamo, who sits in the district Covid-19 taskforce, commended the business community for helping out in refurbishing the isolation hospital. “We are grateful that we are not alone as Gweru City Council in the fight against the spread of this scourge at local level,” he said. “We have companies like River Valley Properties, which have literally adopted the hospital, providing new bedding that includes sheets, blankets etc. They are also providing food to the hospital’s staff. “We also have other companies like Mimosa Mining Company, they did a tremendous job to give our hospital a major facelift.” Vice President Kembo Mohadi, who is the chairperson for the National Covid-19 taskforce recently visited the hospital and expressed satisfaction with the renovations.
