THE Highlanders pair of midfielder Brian Banda and striker Tinashe Makanda have signed pre-contracts with PSL champions FC Platinum.

Impeccable sources said the duo and FC Platinum will formalise their union once Zifa gives guidelines on player movement during Covid-19. “Makanda and Banda are going to FC Platinum.

At FC Platinum, the duo will reunite with Dutch coach Hendrick Pieter de Jongh and midfielder Denzel Khumalo, who both ditched Bosso at the end of last season. More details to follow
