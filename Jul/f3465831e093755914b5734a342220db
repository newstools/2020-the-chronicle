Midfielder Innocent Kutsanzira and Bulawayo City FC return to court today to finalise on the salary dispute between the two parties. Kutsanzira dragged his former paymasters, accusing them of non-payment of salary. The two parties are making a third appearance today where the Labour Court is expected to conclude the matter. Last week the court advised Kutsanzira and City to hold a round table meeting and amicably try to address the player’s concerns. Kutsanzira is being represented by labour consultant Mavurere Makore, while City’s vice-chairman Zenzo Moyo is leading the club’s defence. The central midfielder sustained a career-ending injury in August last year in a Zifa Southern Region Division One League match between City and CIWU and he accused the Premiership side of neglecting him by not paying his medical expenses despite getting injured on club duty. Kutsanzira broke his leg on August 16, 2019 and an orthopedic surgeon diagnosed it as a displaced fracture of the right tibia and fibula. City took him to a private Bulawayo hospital where he was operated on, and argue that they met all contractual obligations until Kutsanzira’s contract expired in March. According to the City defence papers, they cleared the player’s outstanding 2017 bonuses on March 2. and also deposited bonuses and signing on fees totalling $1 950 on March 2. Kutsanzira was paid his January and February salaries on March 25, with his outstanding March salary cleared on June 11 . @ZililoR
