Kwekwe City councillors have passed a resolution to appoint Dr Lucia Mnkandla as substantive Town Clerk. Dr Mnkandla, a long serving Chamber Secretary, has been acting Town Clerk for the mining town since the retirement of Mr Emmanuel Musara in December 2017. Kwekwe Mayor, Councillor Angeline Kasipo confirmed the development in an interview. “As council we have recommended that Dr Mnkandla be appointed substantive Town Clerk. We made the recommendation as a council and we have since submitted our recommendation to Government,” said Clr Kasipo. She said Dr Mnkandla who has served the city for more than a decade, is the best candidate for the job. “We decided to go for the devil we know. Dr Mnkandla has been there with us and we have seen what she is capable of doing hence our decision to recommend her for the job,” said Clr Kasipo. She said Dr Mnkandla has turned around the fortunes of the city since she tookover as acting Town Clerk. Interviews for the post were conducted last year and among those vying for the post are big names in different fields. Law Society of Zimbabwe President who is former Kwekwe Chamber Secretary, Edward Mapara, Chitungwiza Director of Housing Mrs Hazel Sithole and Gweru assistant Finance Director Mr Michael Verenga are some of the people who were interviewed for the job.
