NINETY-FIVE people contributed towards clearing half of Highlanders FC’s legacy debt by raising $400 000 in May and June. Bosso fans embarked on a crowd-funding initiative in May to clear the club’s legacy debt that stands at $862 868. Highlanders South Africa chapter chairman Nodumo Nyathi, who is spearheading the campaign, listed the number of people that contributed in the last two months. “Good morning MaBosso amahle. In May we had 37 people making deposits into the FNB account and 11 contributing to the online Thundafund. In June, 26 made deposits into the FNB account, 17 into Thundafund and four into BancABC Zimbabwe. “So in May and June about 95 people played a part in Highlanders FC Debt Clearance Campaign. Almost half of Bosso’s debt has been cleared by these 95 action oriented individuals. I Just imagine how much we could have done if you also played a part. United we will clear this debt,” wrote Nyathi. Nyathi is hopeful they will clear the club’s arrears at the end of this month if fans match the June contributions. – @ZililoR
