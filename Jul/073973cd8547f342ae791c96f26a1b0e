The Chronicle CHIPPA UNITED have confirmed the appointment of Lehlohonolo Seema as their new coach, offering the tactician a three-year contract. Seema resigned from Bloemfontein Celtic yesterday, a move that paved the way for his appointment at Chippa, who have been seeking a replacement for Rhulani Mokwena. “Chippa United FC hereby confirms that the team has with immediate effect appointed Lehlohonolo Simon Seema as its head coach on a three-year contract,” Chippa said in a statement. “Coach Seema joins the Chilli-Boys from Bloemfontein Celtics FC wherein he put in notable performances and his abilities as a coach at the highest level were evident. “Chairman of the club, Mr Siviwe Mpengesi expressed his support for coach Seema and expressed his confidence in a winning combination between the coach and the ambitions of Chippa United FC during his tenure.” Seema will be the sixth person to sit in the dug-out for Chippa this season in what has been another turbulent campaign for coaches in Nelson Mandela Bay. They started the campaign with Clinton Larsen, but he was replaced for two matches by Duran Francis in September. Wellington Sambu took temporary charge after that, but was replaced by Norman Mapeza who resigned in February. Mokwena came in ‘on loan’ from Orlando Pirates but did not have his contract extended past 30 June, leaving Seema to now fill the vacant post. Seema had been part of the Celtic technical team since 2013, having various stints in charge of the team, the latest since December 2018 when he and John Maduka took over from the Steve Komphela. ­— SuperSport
