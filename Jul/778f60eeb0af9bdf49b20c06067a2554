TEN-member arts outfit, Sunduza Dance Theatre is set to drop a song and visuals for a love track titled Ubuhle Bakho this Friday. The renowned group which has been in the game for the past 35 years, has evolved through the years as it has adapted to the current trends as exhibited in their artistic work. Operating from one of the city’s oldest suburbs, Old Pumula, Sunduza Dance Theatre focuses on theatre and music productions. They have five musical albums under their belt and the song Ubuhle Bakho is their new offering this year. The outfit’s public relations officer, Lynda Sithole said the song which will be released on their YouTube page, Sunduza TV, was composed by the group’s artistic director, Charles Banda aka Mahlaba. It features FabG Mtshana Ka gogo. The video was shot at several locations in Bulawayo by Veins Media. “Ubuhle Bakho is largely about love. In the video, we show different types of love from the fancy love, the teenage love to the rural love,” Sithole said. She said the song was inspired by the fact that everyone, at one point in life, is faced with a time where they fall in love unconditionally. “What inspired the song is the joy that you get when you fall in love with someone. The lyrics capture this as the song talks about the happiness and beauty of having someone in your life.” Sithole however said they would have loved to have more productions but their plans have been affected by the national lockdown. “We could not do much as most of the time we are holed up at our homes as a result of the lockdown,”she said.- @mthabisi_mthire.
