The Chronicle SAFA has confirmed that match officials have begun checking in to the PSL’s bio-bubble despite the league yet to confirm the restart date. Safa is sticking to its commitment to have referees ready for the resumption of the 2019/20 domestic season after the first group was tested and checked into a hotel in Sandton yesterday. With Gauteng having been identified as the PSL’s biologically safe environment, and though it remains unclear whether the season will go ahead or be cancelled, the association is going full steam ahead with preparations for the match officials. “South African Football Association has called up the first group of match officials to camp at a Johannesburg hotel in anticipation of the resumption of professional football on 1 August 2020,” read a statement from Safa yesterday. “The match officials checked in at a Sandton hotel and all underwent Covid-19 testing. “The next group is expected to arrive next week and will also be tested and complete the pool required for the remainder of the season. “Safa chief medical officer Dr Thulani Ngwenya said he is happy with the Covid-19 safety compliance measures at the hotel as well as the condition of the officials he has seen. “He added that the association is now awaiting the match schedule from the PSL in order to process their appointment for the respective matches.” The PSL was set to hold a board of governors meeting yesterday to deliberate on the way forward, but this has since been postponed to Monday following the death of chairman Irvin Khoza’s second wife on Thursday. — KickOff
