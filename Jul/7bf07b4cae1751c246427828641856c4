The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma Showbiz Correspondent  FAST-rising hip hop musician King 98 is on a quest to build relationships with internationally acclaimed musicians in order to boost his profile with his recent collaboration with Tanzania’s Diamond Platnumz being testament to that. The collaboration on song Kachiri which was released this week and accompanied by a video, has shown the 21-year-old artiste’s growth in the music industry. In the past, the young artiste fell prey to criticism from many who argued that his rise to fame was due to the financial muscle of his father. This did not go well with the musician who has been on a mission to prove to critics that he is own person. The Diamond Platnumz collaboration followed other successful one with South African Nasty C on song Wacko and Nigerian Zlatan last year. Through his manager, DJ Simmz, King 98 said he is overwhelmed with the support he is getting from the release of the Kachiri video. He said he hopes to keep the momentum high through more international collaborations. “The collaboration is one of our strategies and ways of building relationships with these artistes who are internationally recognised. Since we have done South Africa and Nigeria,now we’ve gone to East Africa and my fans should expect to level up going forward as we grow the brand King 98,” said DJ Simmz. DJ Simmz said the video was shot in Tanzania in February and releasing it in a lockdown period has been perfect as it will give fans ample time to watch and rate it as well as recommend what the artiste needs to do in future videos.
