Zimbabwean creative producer and conceptual strategist Godwill Tasunga aka G-Factor has called on artistes countrywide to scale up their online presence by monetising the online shows. Online shows have been given birth as artistes are not able to physically perform for their audience due to the ongoing ban of public gatherings. The Bulawayo based G-Factor said with rampant piracy, the money generated by recording songs has dwindled exponentially. “This is not the time to sit back but to blend in and this is very much possible for artistes to make money during this crisis but that would require everyone to go digital. “There are many ways that artistes can monetise online performance and this could be through creating websites just like how people pay for movies which will later mean that the viewership will be restricted to visa payment, EcoCash payment and other modes of payment. Also, artistes can have virtual twitter concerts where they engage IT specialists to have restricted passcodes,” said G-Factor. G-Factor added that: “We could wait forever for things to get back to normal but what we need right now is an action plan with strategic solutions. There’s quite a number of new career opportunities that have become readily available as a result of the global shift but only those willing to see beyond this global catastrophe will get the revelation.” G-Factor is the director of the Suzuki Summer Fashion Drive which was launched in 2019, Bulawayo’s social butterfly and fashion critic. In his recent work, he directed Hwabaraty’s Bavuma music visuals which are great on the eye.
