Do you (yes, you) want to die a second and final death in the lake of unquenchable fire? If not prepared for hell, what have you done or are ready to do while there is till time to defy death which looms large and clear in this world, courtesy of the rampaging coronavirus which has left 589 600-plus lives littered in graves in its wake and which with its current resurgence worldwide, Zimbabwe included, threatens to maul down more lives? The message that the coronavirus daily posts for humankind is that economies being ravaged during the Covid-19 pandemic’s lockdowns, sporting activities, festivals of sorts and all other activities in addition to life itself in this canal world are nothing but vanities that should prompt people to seek permanent refuge in Christendom with faith the way to life ever after. A man of God who preferred anonymity said in Bulawayo this week — when asked by this communicologist what statement he thought the Covid-19 pandemic made to people around the globe — that faith alone in Christ and in God was the solution for the human soul as all other things pointed to the impermanence of life in a world torn apart by strife in addition to other prevailing vanities. He pointed to a resurgence of the virus across the globe in spite of measures being taken by governments, primarily under the auspices of the World Health Organisation during lockdown, to stress the point that only through faith were people guaranteed a permanent solution in the form of eternal life. It therefore behoves on people during lockdown to find Jesus Christ and for those already born again to preach the gospel of love to families, friends and others as a way of bringing them to Jesus Christ who is the way and the light illuminating the narrow straight to God in Heaven and eternity. A preacher on ZBC this week put it equally succinctly by saying that faith was the way to God who is love, the agape love that transforms humanity for everlasting life with our Creator. What the above discourse implies is that, while it is all very well for governments and people down the line to take measures intended to restore normalcy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Church of Jesus Christ should go to all lengths to spread the word to all corners of the world in order for lost souls to make bee-lines to Christ, the citadel of eternal protection before His Church, the light to salvation, is taken out of the world, raptured, to precede the mother of all tribulations as darkness and damnation engulf the world as we know it today and with the devil wreaking havoc. In a way, the coronavirus pandemic should serve as a litmus test for all who tout themselves as men and women of God to demonstrate the stuff of faith which they say they are made with those who blow their noses at God’s messages and at the behest of the traitor, Satan, reawakening to the reality of their eternal damnation along with their master in gehena. Yet were political leaders in our own country and elsewhere around the globe, because of the critical roles they play among citizens in their native countries, became God’s true faithfuls themselves, forgiving their rivals for any wrong done to them or for wrongs done by themselves to others in struggles for power and forgetting all these altogether, unequalled peace and stability would rein around the globe with economies blossoming as a result of the stability. Thus were these leaders and the traditional men and women of God to make love the axis on which the world moves round and round, the concept “torrential” might fall far less in describing the torrent of blessings from God to our world as a new, typical replica of the world He loved so much after creation that He sent to it His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to redeem it of all evil before the devil turned things upside down.
