OUT of contract midfielder Brian Banda and striker Tinashe Makanda are likely to stay put at Highlanders following revelations that Bosso are still paying their salaries. Club spokesperson Ronald Moyo confirmed that Highlanders have not stopped paying the duo’s salaries. The duo had reportedly signed pre-contracts with free spending Zvishavane side FC Platinum, although officials at the three-time back-to-back Premiership champions were coy on the issue. It emerged yesterday that Bosso have not abandoned the players, but instead continued paying their salaries, a move that will hugely work in their favour in the event of a dispute and the matter is taken to Zifa and or Fifa. According to Fifa guidelines on addressing legal consequences of Covid-19, the world football motherbody noted that player contracts usually end when the season ends, with a termination date that coincides with the end of the season, but with most leagues around the world having been suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was therefore obvious that the season would not end as envisaged. Fifa proposed that in line with the original intention of the parties when the contract was signed and to also preserve sporting integrity and stability, such contracts should be extended until such a time that the season actually ends. <img class="wp-image-419149 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/brian-banda-new-680x455.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="455" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/brian-banda-new.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/brian-banda-new-360x241.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Brian Banda However, in situations like in the Zimbabwean context whereby the season had not even started when football was paralysed, Fifa says a similar principle must be applied where entry into force of such contracts is delayed until the next season actually starts. This means clubs were not legally bound to pay salaries for players soon after announcement that the start of the season has been halted, but only did that on humaniratian grounds. “The club has been trying its best to meet its contractual obligations even during this difficult period. In terms of salaries, we are up to date with every player,” said Moyo. With Highlanders showing a willingness to engage by meeting the two players’ salaries even though legally they no longer have an obligation, the club is acting exactly according to Fifa expectations and what it (Fifa) will look at in the event that the two parties fail to reach an agreement. “While it is primarily up to the relevant parties at national level to find solutions to fit the circumstances in their own country, Fifa recommends looking at all aspects of each situation in an even manner, including what government measures are there to support clubs and players, whether pay should be deferred or reduced and what insurance coverage may exist. “If parties cannot agree and, as a consequence, cases come to Fifa, the factors to be examined will include the following, whether there was a genuine attempt by the club to reach agreement with the players, what the economic situation of the club is, the proportionality of any adjustment to player contracts, the net income position of players after any contract adjustment, whether players have been treated equally or not,” stated Fifa.
