THE second edition of the Ezekhaya Arts Awards Meant to celebrate Zimbabwean artistes based in South Africa hangs in the balance with organisers saying they are monitoring the Covid-19 situation in the neighbouring country. The awards hosted by CC Media which runs an online channel, Ezakithi TV in South Africa, were supposed to be held in April this year but due to the pandemic, those plans had to be shelved. Speaking from Johannesburg, CC Media director Cruz ‘Mc’ Moyo said they are now planning to host the awards ceremony online. “Since we had already paid for some services that cannot be rendered online, we’re contemplating on hosting the event online,” Mc said. He said the first edition held last year gave local artistes based in South Africa a chance to be part of a red carpet event while having their talents appreciated. “We feel like there are many artistes who’re doing great, but are not being celebrated in their spaces. We want to reward and motivate them to do more through these awards,” said Moyo. The ceremony was held in May at Hillbrow Theatre and there were 25 categories, of which some were honorary awards while some were voted for by fans. Some of the honorary awards went to Madlela Skhobokhobo, Madalaboy, Ndux Malax, TK Kholwani Dube and Omkhula. @mthabisi_mthire
