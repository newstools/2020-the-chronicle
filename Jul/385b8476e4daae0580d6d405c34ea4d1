THE rise in Covid-19 cases in Bulawayo and Harare has forced Zimbabwe Cricket to abort training programmes for national team players that had been preparing for the Afghanistan series in the two cities. ZC decided to break the training camp on Tuesday, with its communications manager Darlington Majonga saying the players have been given programmes to follow at home. Cricket had been given the green light to resume training during the Covid-19 lockdown. The senior national men’s team has been training for the past month while awaiting government approval to host Afghanistan for a limited overs series between July and August. Bulawayo-based national team players that tested negative for Covid-19 have been training under the guidance of former national team fast bowler and Bulawayo provincial coach Njabulo Ncube at Queens Sports Club. Zimbabwe now has over 2 000 confirmed Covid-19 cases, which include 510 recoveries and 26 deaths. Bulawayo is the pandemic’s epicenter, with 593 cases followed by Harare with 579. Majonga said ZC remains hopeful that the Afghanistan tour will proceed. “The July to August timeline was just a tentative date. The dates for the tour will be determined by the government’s response. We wrote to government and are waiting for their response,” said Majonga.
