THE Zimbabwe School Examination Council (Zimsec) has temporarily closed its Harare branch and head office in the capital city after 11 staff members tested positive using the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT). The employees will undergo further tests using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test which provides accurate Covid-18 results. Normal business will resume next Tuesday  following the closure. Zimsec said its offices were closed in line with World Health Organisation regulations and Government Covid-19 prevention measures. “This closure is to facilitate thorough disinfection of our offices as a precautionary measure to mitigate against the spread of COVID 19. This measure has been taken after 11 members of staff tested positive to the virus. The 11 members were subjected to the RDT and we await the results of the PCR tests,” read the statement. “Zimsec like other establishments, has not been spared by the COVID 19 pandemic therefore to ensure the safety of our Staff and stakeholders, mandatory testing is being conducted for all personnel,” it said.
