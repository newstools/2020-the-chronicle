TWELVE finalists for this year’s Miss Mpopoma pageant have been announced and are expected to take part in it in September. The pageant which is being hosted by Ibrah Modelling Agency (IMA) is meant to give aspiring models in the western suburbs a platform to showcase their talent. The finalists are namely Zanele Moyo (17) from Emgànwini, Sandile Dube (18) from Njube, Sheron Makiwa (19) from Nguboyenja, Letlohonolo D.Dube (18) from Southworld, Sizalobuhle Tshuma (19) from Pumula South, Natasha Marko (19) from Pumula South and Mellisa Moyo (17) from Emganwini.

IMA founder Ibraheem “Ibrah” Kuvawoga said: “We are now doing online votes for the pageant’s People’s Choice and the voting will be conducted on our social media platforms, that’s Instagram and Facebook starting from July 1 for a month and then in August we will start rehearsals for the main show.” Those who will come out tops are set to get contracts with the modelling agency where they will be further groomed and given exposure. The inaugural Miss Mpopoma held last year saw Precious Mguni clinching the crown. She is expected to crown her successor at this year’s contest. @mthabisi_mthire
