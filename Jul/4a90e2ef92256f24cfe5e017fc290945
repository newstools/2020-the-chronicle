Bulawayo film practitioners under the banner Is’khetho Productions have teamed up to work on a drama project titled which seeks to address gender based violence issues. The drama production house has already shot three episodes of the drama in the city’s high density suburbs from the targeted seven episodes. Written and produced by Methuli Luphahla and directed by Sandile T Mele Ubudlwangudlwangu features Nqobile Nkomo as Mr Nyathi, Takitso Takudzwa Sibanda as Njemba, Andrew Magolide as Magolide, Cookie Nyathi as Mrs Nyathi and Luphahla as Zakes. Luphahla said the first episode will be released on August 7 on the production’s YouTube, Facebook and Instagram pages. The official launch of the drama is set to be held physically at a venue yet to be announced. “The main aim of the drama series is to stop gender based violence and drug abuse while educating young people in our Zimbabwean society about GBV,” Luphahla said. “Due to lack of funding, sponsorship and equipment, we’ll only be doing seven episodes.” – @mthabisi_mthire
