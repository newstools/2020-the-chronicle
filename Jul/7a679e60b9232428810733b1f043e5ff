The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent A NEW talent search show named Rap Star Zimbabwe which has been created to unearth hip hop talent in the country has extended its call for budding and aspiring hip hop artistes to register for auditions till further notice. The ultimate winner of the search is set to walk away with US$4 000, a recording deal and a vehicle with auditions set to take place in Harare and Bulawayo in the coming months. For the first round of auditions to be spearheaded by a panel of judges made up of local hip hop gurus, an artiste will be judged over a freestyle or verse of 16 bars over a chosen instrumental or they could be asked to perform pre-recorded material. The platform is expected to open doors for the young musicians in the hip hop line of music. Executive producer of the talent search, Aldrian “Beefy” Harrison, who organises the Zimbabwe Hip Hop Music Awards said: “So far, 74 people have registered for the auditions with the bulk from Harare, followed by Bulawayo. “The situation out there (pandemic) has made people a bit hesitant about moving and therefore we have extended the call for registration. “The target is to get a minimum of 100 artistes for season one and there are also plans for artistes to come and register on the day of the auditions as we want the talent search to begreat.” @mthabisi_mthire
