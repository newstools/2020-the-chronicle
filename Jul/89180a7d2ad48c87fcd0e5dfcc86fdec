HIGHLANDERS’ annual mid-year review meeting traditionally held around mid-year has been deferred to a later date due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has paralysed sporting activities worldwide. There was no constitutionally set date for the extraordinary meeting, although since enactment of the clause for the club to hold a review meeting, it has traditionally been held during the Premier Soccer League mid-season break to give members time to attend the meeting. Highlanders chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube confirmed deferment of the meeting in a brief response to Chronicle Sport. “Yes, it’s deferred to a point where it will be possible to hold a public meeting of its nature,” said Dube. The meeting would have provided Bosso members an opportunity to be apprised by club chairman Kenneth Mhlophe on the sponsorship issue following the pulling out of mobile network operator NetOne. The pullout left the club in a quandary as NetOne was footing the team’s salaries, which the club has to continue to pay despite inaction caused by the lockdown. Another issue members would have been keen to know is players, whose contracts have expired, but were in the coach’s plans. Players such as gritty midfielder Brian Banda and striker Tinashe Makanda have reportedly signed pre-contracts with Zvishavane side FC Platinum. Members would want to know why the club failed to renew the duo’s contracts, especially since it’s part of a resolution from a previous annual general meeting that contract negotiations must be held when a player still has more than six months left. Sources yesterday claimed a member had offered to pay for Banda, but the club dragged its feet on the offer.
