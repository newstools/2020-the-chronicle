A 22-YEAR-OLD Filabusi man has been arrested after he allegedly fatally stabbed his friend for drinking his beer without permission. Thulani Hlongwane of Gangabeza was not asked to plead when he appeared briefly before Gwanda magistrate, Miss Lerato Nyathi facing a murder charge. He was remanded in custody to August 4. Prosecuting, Miss Ethel Mahachi said Hlongwane and the now-deceased, Khumbulani Moyo were drinking beer at Gangabeza Business Centre with their friends when the incident occurred. He said Hlongwane left his beer and went to relieve himself and when he returned, he discovered that Moyo had drank it leading to the misunderstanding. “On 6 March at around 9PM the now deceased Khumbulani Moyo and Thulani Hlongwane and three others were drinking beer at Gangabeza Business Centre when Hlongwane left his bottle of beer to relieve himself. Upon his return Hlongwane realised that someone had consumed most of his beer and demanded to know who it was,” she said. “Moyo jokingly admitted that it was him and started making fun of Hlongwane for making a big deal about his missing beer. This pissed off Hlongwane who demanded his beer back and accused Moyo of disrespecting him. Hlongwane started assaulting Moyo but their peers intervened and managed to break up the fight.” Miss Mahachi said the gang then dispersed. She said as they were leaving the business centre, Hlongwane confronted Moyo, stabbed him twice in the stomach and fled. Miss Mahachi said Moyo was rushed to Filabusi District Hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. The matter was reported to the police resulting in Hlongwane’s arrest-@DubeMatutu
