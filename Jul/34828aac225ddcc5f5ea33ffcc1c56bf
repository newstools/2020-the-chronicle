MADLELA Skhobokhobo’s Ntikoloshi album launch is hanging in the balance again as it is expected to be postponed for the third time due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The Ngamnanka uSaMamo hit-maker had set August 7 as the day he would finally launch his third album. This was after he was forced to abort the initial launch that was scheduled for Phoenix Night Club in Gwanda on April 4 due to the Covid-19 pandemic which saw public gatherings being banned. Now, with lockdown measures having been tightened due to the increase in local Covid-19 cases in the country, Madlela will no longer be able to launch his album again. The album, a follow up to Majazana which he released last year is set to have a mixture of rhumba, tshibilika, Afro-jazz, house and gospel tunes. The tracks are Ntikoloshi, Karikiriki, Salibonani, Njelele featuring Nkosi, I 50 duuu, Station featuring Iyasa, Emasurbabsin featuring Awa, Hwabaraty and Bajilla, Khumbule Khaya, Impi and Tambai which features Bajila. Commenting on the delay of the launch, Madlela said: “I’m working very hard to make sure it’s held online. For now, we haven’t finalised the date but I’m working on it.” With the musician having hinted on an outfit makeover, fans are anticipating to see the new outfit at the launch. – @mthabisi_mthire.
