LOCAL football clubs must engage their players and negotiate contract extensions instead of waiting for Zifa to give them direction on how to deal with contracts that have lapsed. Following reports that league champions FC Platinum and Chicken Inn are interested in the services of Highlanders midfielder Brian Banda, whose contract expired on June 30, agents warned clubs against starting negotiations when they have lapsed. “Covid-19 or not, clubs should engage players before the contracts expire. They have to move with speed and try to keep players unless they are not interested in a player,” said player agent Daly Bhebhe. Local clubs are reportedly waiting for Zifa to communicate a raft of Fifa guidelines to be followed regarding player movement during and post Covid-19. Fifa guidelines are silent on contracts that expire during the course of the season, leaving local clubs and players in limbo. The guidelines favour leagues that are aligned to the Fifa calendar that were already underway at the outbreak of Covid-19. @ZililoR
