Self-proclaimed king of rhumba Juntal has bowed to pressure from the public and has decided to work on a remix of his hit track, Mutupo. Juntal, whose real name is Farai Serima, said the remix will also come with a video and is expected out by end of this month. The singer has three albums to his name. Mutupo which praises different totems, became a hit when it was released three years ago. It is still being played at functions, especially weddings. “I gave in to pressure from my fans to come up with a remix of Mutupo. I’m glad to say we’ll be releasing the audio track by end of this month,” said Juntal. “On the video, we want to introduce a dance competition whereby every totem will be represented by people from that totem. It’ll be like a dance competition and we want to see who does it better on the dance floor.” After the video is released, Juntal said the dance competition for the track will be launched across the country with people from different totems in the song being encouraged to showcase their talent.
