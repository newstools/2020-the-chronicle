AMBITIOUS Zifa Southern Region Division One side Talen Vision has ventured into construction and engineering services. The Talen Vision Construction and Engineering department is into brick moulding and steel fabrication, and they produce standard bricks, blocks, wheelbarrows, window frames and scaffolds among other things. Their main target market is the Filabusi mining community in Insiza district. Speaking to Chronicle Sport, Talen Vision projects manager Mishon Tsabalaka said this venture was the brainchild of club president Khumbulani Nkomo. “The club is now generating its own income through the construction and engineering department. The idea in the longterm is to wean Talen Vision Football Club from the Trukumb Mining sponsorship,” said Tsabalaka. He they’re currently producing 100 000 bricks per month, while wheelbarrows, window frames, scaffolds other products are largely dependent on orders. Whilst other clubs find themselves financially hamstrung due to the Covid-19 enforced inactivity, they’re vigorously pursuing this new financial revenue stream that is helping them to meet player wages. Nkomo said the club’s construction department has since been contracted by Trukumb Mining to build 14 townhouses for the mine’s workers in Filabusi. “It’s a project worth between US$1.4 million and should be complete by 21 August. As a club I think we are moving in the right direction because six months down the line jobs have been created realising US$26 000 so far,” said Nkomo. Many Premier Soccer League clubs risk bankruptcy because of the short-term prospect of playing games in empty stadiums coupled with the longterm struggle to retain and find sponsors. Big teams like Highlanders and Caps United are finding the going tough after their sponsors NetOne decided to cut ties with the two clubs in the first month of the lockdown. – @FungaiMuderere
