MORE than 176 000 households in the Midlands province have received food aid from Government to cushion them from hardships following poor yields and challenges brought about by the Covid-19 outbreak. Midlands Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Senator Larry Mavima said the province had received more than 25 000 tonnes of maize which was distributed among 176 290 households. “As a province we have received 25 539 tonnes of grain from the Government. This excludes the contribution of other partners such as the World Food Programme among other donations. “The grain that we received from the Government was distributed among 176 290 families in the province. All the districts received food aid in the province,” he said. Minister Mavima said the province has embarked on a needs assessment exercise to identify families that are food insecure so that they receive grain. “Most households received food aid. There were some areas where there were delays and their food was stuck at our depots. “We are also doing another assessment to see families that are food insecure. We also still have a challenge in terms of food,” he said. Minister Mavima said the province has embarked on an agricultural programme which seeks to train more than 6 125 farmers to mitigate food shortages in the province. “We have a programme called Pfumvudza which is an agricultural programme that trains farmers. “We want our farmers to also try zero tillage. So far there are 67 extension officers that would train farmers on the programme,” he said. Minister Mavima said the province was also getting assistance from the business community to fight Covid-19.
