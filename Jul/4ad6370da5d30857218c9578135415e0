A 17-year-old schoolboy who raped his five-year-old sister has been sentenced to a wholly suspended five years in prison on condition of good behaviour. The Form Three pupil, who cannot be named for ethical reasons appeared before Gweru Regional Magistrate Mrs Phathekile Msipa facing one count of rape. He pleaded not guilty to the charge. Mrs Msipa convicted and sentenced him to five years in jail. In passing the sentence, the regional magistrate said the boy was lucky to escape jail because of his age. “The accused is still a minor but he started committing an offence at the deeper end. Society frowns at such cases where a brother rapes his sister who will be looking up to him for protection. He is sentenced to five years wholly suspended for five years,” said Mrs Msipa. Prosecutor Mr Talent Tadenyika told the court that on October 25 last year at around 12PM, the complainant was with her brother in his bedroom. He closed the door and raped the complainant and was caught in the act by their mother. The matter was reported to the police leading to the arrest of the accused. Meanwhile, a then 17-year-old fugitive has been arrested after five years on the run after he allegedly raped his then 11-year-old cousin. The man who is now 22 years old appeared before the same court yesterday for trial. He pleaded not guilty and was remanded in custody to July 30 for continuation of trial. The complainant is now 17 years old.
