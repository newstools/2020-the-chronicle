A 64-year-old man from Jengwe outside Victoria Falls who allegedly fatally struck his 24-year-old son with a machete for having an affair with a juvenile girl has been released on $1 000 bail. Victoria Falls magistrate Ms Linda Dzvene granted Concern Ncube of Jengwe Village 3 under Chief Mvutu bail after the accused’s lawyer Mr Thulani Nkala of Dube, Nkala and Company the High Court granted the consent order. The magistrate ordered Ncube to reside at his homestead, not interfere with witnesses and to report at Victoria Falls Police Station once a month on Mondays pending trial. The remand date remains July 14 which Ncube was remanded to on his initial appearance last week. Ncube, who is employed at a lodge, has not been asked to plead to murder. The alleged murder took place at the family home on Tuesday last week when Ncube and his now deceased son Dumezweni allegedly had a misunderstanding over an affair the late had with a minor girl. The girl’s age was not given. According to prosecutors, the fight and murder took place in the presence of the accused’s wife Mrs Joyce Ncube and his other son Zenzo. “On 23 June and at home, the accused unlawfully and intentionally caused the death of his son Dumezweni Ncube by striking him once on the forehead with a machete after a family dispute,” said prosecutor Mr Onias Nyathi. The court was told that Ncube rebuked his son about his alleged affair and he confronted his father. The misunderstanding degenerated into a fight resulting in Ncube picking up a machete which he used to attack his son. Dumezweni collapsed and died moments later before he could be taken to hospital, the court was told. A report was made to the police leading to Ncube’s arrest. -@ncubeleon
