What makes Kolobetsha different from his other albums is its modern influences and the versatility in the types of sounds incorporated. I’m also going to continue to focus on putting more energy and time towards the accompanying visuals for his upcoming singles. In fact, the next music video will continue to feature AfriArt, a Bulawayo-Based Entertainment company,” said Hwabaraty.
