Yesterday, the memorial service was held at his museum in Matsheumhlophe suburb and was led by Father Jeremy Dube. Minister Ncube narrated an emotional visit she made with other women during Dr Nkomo`s last days in hospital. “A week before his death we hired a ZUPCO bus with other women. We felt compelled to visit and show support to umama uMaFuyana in Harare. When we got there, security details at the hospital told us that we could not all see him. Only seven of us were allowed to enter, that on its own told us that his condition was not good. Umama uMafuyana met us and led us to his ward. When we got there, the late Umdala Wethu was not moving. UMafuyana whispered to him and said ‘Khulu nampa abantwana basilandile ukuzosibona.’ He tried to speak but because of his condition he could not, MaFuyane again went to his ear and whispered, ‘khulu sebezwile abantwana.’ After that she led us out,” she said. <img class="wp-image-502704 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/nkomo-commemorations-3-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/nkomo-commemorations-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/nkomo-commemorations-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Father Zimbabwe Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo’s younger brother Edward (left) gives an account at the memorial service to commemorate the icon’s life in Bulawayo yesterday The minister said the encounter moved them so much that when they got to the bus, they all sat and no one said anything. “There was silence on the bus until we reached Kadoma, those who did not manage to see him were then demanding to know what transpired and we told them that the situation was not good. As we remember the late father Zimbabwe let us not forget his wife uMafuyane who was beside him through it all,” said the minister.
