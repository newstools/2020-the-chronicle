POLICE in Bulawayo are investigating a suspected murder incident after skeletal remains were found wrapped in a cloth and dumped near a stream in Njube suburb. The remains of an unknown adult were found last Monday afternoon by a passerby who alerted cops. Cops suspect that the body could have been in the area for at least four months. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said cops were suspicious that the victim could have been killed and the body dumped at the stream to conceal the crime. He said the remains were taken to the United Bulawayo Hospitals for post mortem, which would guide police investigations. “The fact that the remains were wrapped in a cloth indicates that foul play is suspected. An informant discovered a human skeleton in a swampy area in ‘O’ square, Njube suburb Bulawayo on 6 July 2020 at about 12PM. The informant was doing a routine check on water drainage trenches behind the gardens and he found the skeleton by the edge of the drainage,” he said. He said police’s Homicide and Criminal Investigations Department (CID) attended the crime scene and observed that the remains were dismembered. “The human skeleton was lying facing upwards wrapped with a yellow-whitish cloth. The skull and some of the ribs were detached from the main skeleton. It was also observed that the skeleton is of an adult but could not ascertain gender and age. The state of the remains shows that the body might have been at the place for a period exceeding four months. Perimeter checks were made at the scene and nothing was found that could link to the identity of the deceased,” he said. — @nqotshili
