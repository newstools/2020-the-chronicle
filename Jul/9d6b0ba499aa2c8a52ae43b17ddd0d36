SUNGURA musicians Sulumani “Sulu” Chimbetu and Peter “Young Igwe” Moyo seem to be on the right track of reviving the sungura genre after they won twice in a row, the sungura vs dancehall clash during a competition that took place on the Nash TV Friday Night Live show. The sungura musicians, in the first leg of the competition held in May, outshone their dancehall counterparts Kinnah and Bazooka. On Friday, they outshone Enzo Ishall and Soul Jah Love. The voting process was held on Saturday where the first genre to get 1 000 comments for a splendid, performance were adjudged winners. Warming up the stage on Friday was Shugeta, an MC for the sungura genre who set the bar high with an audible stint which portrayed the sungura genre as a lion that is going to pit its rival, a dog. Dancehall MC Merciless was unfazed as his entry was sublime through the sorrowful song Tormented Soul, that normally hits the airwaves towards Heroes Day commemorations in August or every time a hero or heroine dies, was used to honour late sungura aces that include Tongai Moyo and Simon Chimbetu among others. An energetic vibe followed from a genre which since its inception always leaves a euphoric frenzy in the capital’s nightspots. The Young Igwe and his band did not disappoint as they put on a stellar performance through their instrumentals and dances. After Young Igwe’s performance, fans were in unison that he had come of age. Next on stage was Enzo Ishall who was accompanied on stage by his ghetto fellas. Their clarks and hilarious dances kept the comments section alive. Sulu also showed that with age comes maturity as he took people down memory lane. Soul Jah Love wrapped up the show with a spirited act that made some conclude that dancehall had won, but that was to change in the coming hours.
