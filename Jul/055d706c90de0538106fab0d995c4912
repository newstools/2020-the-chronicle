Apostolic Faith Mission (AFM) Gospel Church Choir (GCC) and Gweru-based Joyful Praise Choir will be reaching out to their followers through a virtual performance during Fusion Media Group (FMG)’s Let’s Worship show on Sunday evening. The show is expected to be shown on FMG, comedian Nceku and Megafest Holdings Facebook pages. AFM GCC leader Christina Mutangara said with most choirs now dormant because of the public gathering restrictions that have limited church gatherings to not more than 50, they are trying to keep their choir alive by ensuring their members practise individually. “Most members were practising as individuals and as a choir which has been together for long, it hasn’t been hard for us to resurface after the lockdown restrictions were lifted allowing churches to gather. “The main aim is to worship and we don’t worship for people, but for God. We believe we’ll be in the same spirit with the people while they are in the comfort of their homes,” said Mutangara. Mutangara, however, said due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most of their musical plans were disrupted. But, they are trying to make up for all the lost time and are anticipating to release a DVD. Joyful Praise Choir leader Pastor Gamaliel Blessing Madindi said they were locked down in camp, something which gave them ample time to work on their art. Madindi said they are already in Bulawayo for the online event that will take place from the FMG Studios. – @mthabisi_mthire.
