THE Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) has dismissed claims circulating on social media platforms that its operations at Beitbridge had come to a stand still with customs officers reportedly on a go slow. There was anxiety among importers and exporters for the better part of the day with the news of a purported job action filtering through social media. In an official statement today, Zimra dismissed the news as fake and misleading. “There have been misleading reports that Zimra employees at Beitbridge border post have engaged in a strike. “Employees have reported to duty as normal. There is no strike. “We would want to assure the transacting public that the authority continues to provide uninterrupted service at the borders,” said Zimra. When the news crew visited the border it was business as usual with commercial trucks entering and leaving the country uninterrupted. Zimra is clearing an average of 1000 commercial trucks at Beitbridge Border Post daily. Traffic at the country’s southern border has been increasing since the beginning of the lockdown following the closure of many transit borders in Sadc region. Zimbabwe has remained a viable transit route for countries north of the Zambezi River including Angola,  Tanzania, Malawi, DRC  and Zambia.
