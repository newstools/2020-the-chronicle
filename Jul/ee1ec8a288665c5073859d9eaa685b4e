VICTORIA Falls-based radio presenter, DJ JVAN has made a music comeback with the release of a single which features award-winning rapper, Msiz’Kay. The single, a fusion of Hip Hop and Afro Trap, titled Wadidizela was released last Friday. JVAN (real name Jonathan Sibanda), a producer and voice-over artiste at Breeze FM presents the Vuka Lathi Breakfast show and OK Zimbabwe Chart Rockers Top 20. Before venturing into broadcasting in 2011, JVAN was a musician who had songs, Aphi Amantombazane which he did with Keig and Msheznana in 2008 and Tshona Phansi in 2009. However, the songs did not make the noise he wanted them to. He then released another single, Yizo Ezabomrepha in 2011 before he began his broadcast journey. Now after nine years, he has returned to the studio to record music as he believes music is his calling. “I believe music is a calling, a gift to be shared with the world. This is something I’ve always known I have to do so I’m doing so now,” JVAN said. He said Wadidizela which was produced by Chuchu Manie of Danica Studios seeks to encourage people to remain focused in life and guided by their strong beliefs. “The song carries with it, the message of focus and choosing and staying grounded on your beliefs hence the title Wadidizela which means to ‘bustle about.’ “I’m excited to have worked with award-winning Msiz’Kay,” said JVAN. He said he developed a passion for music at the age of 16 when he started as a DJ and rapper. In his career, he has done voice-overs for various events and deejaying at Mapopoma Festival and Econet Marathon. — @ncubeleon
