AN accounts clerk at Hwange Local Board (HLB) has been arrested for allegedly defrauding the local authority of close to $200 000. Maxwell Kwidini (29) of Empumalanga suburb in Hwange allegedly transferred the money from the local authority’s two bank accounts to his personal account on four occasions between December last year and February this year. Kwidini allegedly transferred $33 954 to his account on December 2 last year and another $142 810,64 on December 30. The money was supposed to be paid to Soms and Lo Digital who had been contracted to supply an iPhone XS for the Town Secretary Mr Ndumiso Mdlalose and 14 tablets for HLB councillors. The accused allegedly delivered the gadgets instead of the supplier doing so, and the local authority did not get receipts or delivery notes for the purchases. On two other counts, Kwidini allegedly separately transferred $4 267 and $5 175 from the local authority’s bank account to his personal account claiming the money was for his fuel, travel and subsistence allowances for attending a procurement meeting in Harare although he did not attend any. Kwidini, who is out of custody on his own cognisance to Monday next week, pleaded not guilty to four counts of fraud when he appeared before Hwange magistrate Ms Rangarirai Gakanje. The State led evidence from Mr Mdlalose, Human Resources Officer Mr Mhlupheki Mlilo and Internal Auditor Mr Freetime Khuphe.
