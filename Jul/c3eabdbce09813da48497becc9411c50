POLICE in Bulawayo are investigating a case of a man from Hillside suburb who allegedly assaulted his girlfriend’s disabled 32-year-old son over an undisclosed issue. The picture of a beaten-up Mr Ryan Abrahams made rounds on social media recently after the victim’s sister who is based in Australia posted asking for urgent help to stop the abuse. As a result, police were notified and Mr Allan Howard was arrested. He had allegedly been physically abusing Mr Abrahams at Qalisa Retirement Village in Suburbs where his girlfriend stays. Allan Howard is going to appear in court soon facing assault charges and Mr Abrahams is helping police with investigations. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube confirmed the incident and urged members of the public to continue reporting cases of domestic violence. “We are investigating a physical abuse case from Qalisa where a disabled man was assaulted by his mother’s boyfriend. The victim has since gone for medical examination and we hope to get a medical report which we will use in our investigations,” said Insp Ncube. Insp Ncube said members of the public are free to approach any nearest police station whenever someone is abused and does not have the capacity to make a report.
