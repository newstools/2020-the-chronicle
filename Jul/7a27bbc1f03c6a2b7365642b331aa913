Followers of virtual shows are in for an action packed weekend as top musicians are billed to perform at three events that are promising to be explosive. Kicking off things tonight are musicians Winky D and Jah Signal who will perform at two different shows which however will be held at the same time. Winky D who will be backed by Iyasa and Sylent Nqo will be live on the PPC Facebook page from 8:30PM while Jah Signal, who has not staged a solo show virtually, will perform at what he has termed as One night with Jah Signal. The virtual show will be shown on the artiste’s Facebook fan page from 8PM. With the Nash TV virtual show which usually takes place on Friday evening having been moved to Saturday because of Jah Prayzah’s birthday celebrations tomorrow, Jah Signal and Winky D’s shows will serve as good replacements although fans will likely be caught in between as the two artistes are equally talented. Tomorrow, Jah Prayzah will take over with his lockdown birthday celebration that will feature performances from himself, Ammara Brown, Tammy Moyo and King 98 on the Nash TV platform. The virtual show will be shown on the Nash TV Facebook page and ZBCtv as from 9:30PM. With the lockdown ongoing, people now rely on such shows for entertainment as they cannot patronise bars and nightclubs which are currently closed because of Covid-19 restrictions.
