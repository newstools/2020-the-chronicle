One of the founding members of the Twelve Apostolic Church, Bishop Zale Ndlovu (Nee Dube), who died last Thursday, has since been buried in Plumtree. She was 88. Bishop Ndlovu, who was one of the country’s oldest serving clerics, is survived by nine children and many grandchildren. Reverend Physant Kikins said the late Bishop Ndlovu founded the church together with her husband. “She formed the church with her husband and other members based in South Africa,” said Rev Kikins. The late Bishop Ndlovu who has been described by many as a humble and respected Christian, had been ill for a long time. Rev Kikins said the void left by Bishop Ndlovu will be difficult to fill. Renowned Plumtree businessman Mr Michael Golden Sibanda echoed the same sentiments saying: “Bishop Ndlovu shaped the lives of many people in Plumtree. “Many of us were nurtured by her. She had a great influence in shaping our lives and we are what we are today because of her,” said Mr Sibanda.
