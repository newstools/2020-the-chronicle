THE sharp increase in Covid-19 infections in the country has forced the Gwanda Tennis Academy to freeze all training activities despite having the licence to operate under strict measures. In an effort to guarantee the safety of players, the academy has seen it fit to call off sessions until the situation improves. The academy’s tournament director Archbald Dungeni said training has been suspended and players will only take to the court whe it is safe to do so. “The surge in new cases favour a cautious approach at the moment. We have also been in touch with other clubs to share notes and at the moment we all agree the safety and health of our members comes first. We had started taking small numbers through their paces but as of last week we have stopped all activity,” said Dungeni. The Covid-19 lockdown crisis has already resulted in postponement of the annual Gwanda Junior Invitational Tennis Tournament, which had become a regular feature on the tennis calander. Sponsors of the competition have indicated that they will support the postponed event. — @innocentskizoe.
