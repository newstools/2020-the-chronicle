UP-AND-COMING Esigodini-based Kasi Rap artiste, Philani “C’Khanda P” Sibanda is set to release a song titled Usizi which he wants to use to reach out to audiences in the rural areas where he comes from. With the rise of Zimbabwean hip-hop in the Matabeleland region that has been propelled by the gale that is rap in Kwaito (Kasi Rap), a juggernaut genre that swept the whole country into a euphoric frenzy, C’Khanda P is working on spreading the genre to the rural areas. The artiste comes from Eshlengeni village and started his musical career in 2014. He draws inspiration from South African musicians, Zola and Guluva 7 who have popularised Kasi Rap. Usizi, C’Khanda P said, talks about people who have turned away from Ubuntu and are engaging in things that bring sorrow. With this song to be released on August 10, he wants to revive Kasi Rap, a genre that seems to be dying. If he gets an opportunity and resources, he said he will go the extra mile and set up a dedicated Kasi Rap record label that will unearth artistes in that genre to keep it alive. “My musical dream is to comfort sad souls through a rap vibe that many people can resonate with. In future, I’d like to set up a recording studio for such artistes in my area. “This is because I’ve realised how hard it is to do music without the requisite resources. It’s just like baffling and doing nothing,” he said. He said the journey to revive Kasi Rap has not been easy. “I’ve done a few tracks, namely Pantsula, Kasi Lami and Ubuhle Bakho and in the process, once formed a Kasi Rap crew in 2015 which faded because we didn’t share the same vision and goals. I didn’t lose hope and stood my ground. “I then met a fellow musician, Agenda Maphosa in 2016 who mentored and motivated me to push harder. That saw me release my debut seven-track album in January this year,” he said. – @mthabisi_mthire.
