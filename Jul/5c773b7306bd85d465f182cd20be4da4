THE Zimbabwe Baseball Association (ZBA) is in  the process of introducing a new format of the sport known as baseball5. Baseball5 is a fast-paced youth-focused urban discipline and small-sided version of baseball or softball. The sport is presently being introduced to stakeholders in the country. According to ZBA president Morris Banda, the association has shifted focus to promoting baseball5, which is easier to play and does not need expensive equipment “Baseball5 was first established by the World Baseball Softball Confederation in 2017. It is a five aside game (three male plus two female players) played over five innings. It is a street version of baseball or softball that requires virtually no equipment and can be played anywhere,” Banda said. Baseball5 has been included in the sports programme of the Youth Olympic Games Dakar in 2022. “It is easy to promote baseball5 due to the fact that you need only a ball and space. During this Covid19 pandemic it is also much safer since there is no exchange of equipment like in baseball and softball that is in terms of use of gloves, bats and helmets, among other required equipment. “We are working on a plan to promote the game as an alternative to baseball and softball during this time and post Covid-19. We have over 40 coaches from baseball and softball that were trained in baseball5 last year. Shepherd Sibanda (in Bulawayo) is an instructor with WBSC and will lead the promotion of baseball5 in Zimbabwe with John Madziro (in Harare),” said Banda. @innocentskizoe
