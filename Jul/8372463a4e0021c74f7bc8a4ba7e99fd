CHURCHES in Bulawayo have welcomed the move by President Mnangagwa to once again, ban church gatherings in a move to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. Churches recently broke the 86-day jinx when they were allowed to operate once again, but due to the rise of Covid-19 cases in the country and city, Government has been forced to once again ban church gatherings until further notice. Johane Masowe Apostle Sector leader, Madzibaba Emmanuel Mutumwa said they will revert to the online worshipping strategy. “As the apostolic church sector, we believe that we have a role to play in supporting the Government. We’re in no position to defy the rules set by the Government thus we welcome their move to re-ban church gatherings. “We’ve since notified congregants that we won’t be congregating physically and our focus now is to have them pray at their homes so as to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. “As such, we’re returning to using the WhatsApp platform for our services,” said Mutumwa. Association of the Apostolic Churches in Zimbabwe (AACZ) President, Bishop Vushe said: “It’s very important to follow the rules and regulations of the Government. The increase in number of the positive coronavirus cases is worrying and we also observed that although churches were operating, most were not following the rules and regulations and did not have the required sanitisers and infrared thermometers. “It was also difficult for the church members to maintain social distance. We urge the nation to pray indoors until the right time comes.” Bishop Vushe said church organisations should not see this as a punishment, but a role for them to play in saving lives. He hailed the frontline workers for their hard work and dedication in such a difficult time. @mthabisi_mthire
