NATIONAL basketball team guard Andile “Ace” Chirinda says the lockdown has not only been a difficult period in his career, but a big learning curve as well. The Bulawayo Basketball League in which he plays, was in the second half of the season when all sporting activities were placed on halt. Their season was set to conclude at the end of March to pave way for the national finals in April, but that was not to be. The Southern Mavericks player says he has been working on his game during the break. “It has been really tough being out of action for three months and counting, as it’s definitely not something that we are used to. In as much as we get workout programmes from our coaches,it is up to us individually to be disciplined enough to go through with those programmes,” said Chirinda. “We don’t really know when we will resume our games so we just try to stay in shape and ready so that won’t have to start from scratch. I work out with my brother, who is also my teammate Nhlanhla. We work out three days per week and can’t wait to get back onto the court. If I’m not working out, I’ll be studying, as I’m a student at Bulawayo Polytechnic.” He said in as much as the pandemic has frozen their games, it had also given them an opportunity to look at other aspects of the game by watching NBA matches and working on a new skills, among other things. Chirinda has also represented the province and the highlight of his career was being called up for national duty last year. He said coach Thokozani Sigola and Mxolisi Ndlovu had been instrumental in shaping his career. —@innocentskizoe
