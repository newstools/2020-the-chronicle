Speaking about the rebroadcast, Selmor Mtukudzi’s publicist, Reginald Chapfunga said: “We are really excited about the rebroadcast set for tomorrow at 8pm as it will give our fans from all over the world an opportunity to watch the band on stage. “It will also recapture the magic of the day for those who attended the launch or watched it live on ZTV early this year. “We invite all our music fans to watch the one-hour long show as it not only gives them a feel of Selmor’s live performance, choreography and music arrangement prowess, but also guarantees the future of her father’s music legacy.” During the launch, Selmor who was backed by the Black Spirits band, sampled tracks from Dehwe Renzou and also played some of her father’s all-time hits. He said the show is a must watch for Oliver Mtukudzi’s fans.
