TANZANIA’s former President Benjamin William Mkapa has died at the age of 81. The country’s President John Magufuli announced Mkapa’s death on Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) this morning. President Magufuli said Mr Mkapa died at Dar es Salaam Hospital where he was admitted. “I call on all Tanzanians to receive the news of his death and to pray for Mzee Mkapa. More information will be released but Mzee Mkapa is no more,” he said in brief television statement. He also declared a seven-day mourning period. During this time, all flags in the country will be flown at half-mast. Mr Mkapa led Tanzania from 1995 to 2005 before handing over to Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete. He was born on November 12, 1938. The former president is known for leading several peace mediation efforts in the region, including taking part in Kenya’s post-election conciliation exercise in 2008. He was part of the Panel of Eminent African Personalities, led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, which ended the post-election violence after the highly disputed December 27, 2007 elections. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Mr Nick Mangwana also tweeted on his official Twitter account expressing condolences to the people of Tanzania following Mkapa’s death. “It is with sadness that we learn of the passing on of Tanzania’s former President Benjamin Mkapa. Tanzania is a country that has stood with the people of Zimbabwe throughout its history from Independence to this day. We join them in mourning this sad loss,” he said. The excellent political relations between Zimbabwe and Tanzania date back to the days of the liberation struggle when the latter gave us invaluable moral, political, diplomatic and material assistance. Since the attainment of our independence, these relations have continued to blossom. @mashnets
