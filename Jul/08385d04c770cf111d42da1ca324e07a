CHEETAHS rugby player Nelson Madida feels the fitness and health training programme he developed during the lockdown had helped grow his brand. His training programme started at the onset of the Covid-19 enforced lockdown at the end of March, with the aim of helping fitness fanatics keep fit. Since then, the programme has attracted a good number of followers, with some participants based in South Africa. In Zimbabwe, Madida has 50 dedicated participants, while others are on and off. “The programme has been a resounding success, especially looking at the numbers that we have accumulated. Right now I’m actually working with some people from South Africa, helping them out in one-on-one sessions. I would say l am growing as a brand through this programme,” said Madida. “The fitness industry is constantly evolving so one should always be able to learn and adapt to your own trend or style of delivering your workouts depending on the needs. I took a different approach with this programme, with the agenda not to only focus on the minority, but majority, hence l choose WhatsApp, which is easily accessible to most people.” What also makes his programme unique is that a friend of his is providing free medical advice on issues like muscle problems and other injuries, making the programme more effective. Madida has also been hosting a mentorship programme online for the youths, focusing on topics ranging from self reflection, identity and influence of the new generation on society. – @innocentskizoe.
