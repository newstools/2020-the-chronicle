DISCO queen, Patricia Majalisa will be buried in her home province, East London this week, and fans will be able to watch her funeral online. Majalisa died of liver failure at Helen Joseph’s Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa last Thursday. This was a year after the death of Dalom Music stalwart Dan Tshanda who passed away on January 5. Majalisa’s spokesperson, Oska Tee said: “It’s been decided that Majalisa will be buried in East London, her birth place. “The only reason for the delay is that there are many things that have to be finalised like the death certificate, but the (lockdown) restrictions have been stalling the process.” He said the date of the burial will be revealed during the week. “Also, we shall let people know how fans who can’t come to her funeral can watch the funeral online so that they mourn together with her family. “This could be on Facebook, YouTube or a special website that will be set up for that,” said Oska Tee. Born on February 15, 1967 in East London, Majalisa rose to fame after the launch of her solo career in 1986. She was initially part of popular Afro pop group, Splash which was headed by Dan Tshanda. Her first album, Cool Down was released in the same year. Her second and third albums, Witchdoctor and Gimba earned her platinum discs with sales in excess of 50 000 copies each. Her fourth and fifth albums Poverty and Dzhengezhe saw her graduate to double platinum status, with sales in excess of 100 000 copies each. The rest of her albums exceeded the 50 000 sales mark each proving her talent and popularity. — @bonganinkunzi.
