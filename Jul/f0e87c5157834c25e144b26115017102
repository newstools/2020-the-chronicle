THE upsurge in local Covid-19 cases is likely to cripple all efforts being put in place to promote domestic tourism in the country, players in the tourismÂ sector have said. Although Government recently partially opened the tourism industry by allowing restaurants and safari operators among other facilities to open for domestic clients, the rise in local infections could reverse the gains. Industry players are now worried that the high hopes by hotels and lodges, tour operators and restaurants for revitalization of the sector through domestic tourism, are almost being shattered by the sudden surge in confirmed positive cases of Covid-19. The concerns come as local transmissions are spiking, with a total of 2 512 including 518 recoveries and 34 deaths that had been recorded as of Tuesday this week. This follows events where a number of public institutions such as courts, police stations, prisons, hospitals and some private entities have been hit by the global pandemic. On Monday Parliament indefinitely suspended public hearings and sittings after two MPs tested positive for Covid-19 during a field visit across the country. On Friday and Saturday the delegation was booked at a local hotel in Victoria Falls, raising fears in the tourism sector. Sources at the hotel said all staff members were tested on Monday and told to self-isolate. Industry executives said they were worried by the development, which leaves the sector hard pressed to balance between national health needs and the future of tourism.
