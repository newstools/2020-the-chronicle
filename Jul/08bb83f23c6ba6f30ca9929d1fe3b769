Madlela Skhobokhobo has begun shooting visuals  for tracks on his upcoming album, Ntikoloshi which is due to be launched next month. Unlike his previous music productions where he just had two videos for Ngamnanka and Celebrate, Madlela who is also an actor, has gone a gear up with this album as he wants to tap into the online world using visuals hence why he is shooting six videos. These are for tracks, Station featuring Iyasa, I 50 duuu, Impi, Njelele featuring Nkosi, Salibonani and the album title track Ntikoloshi. He said the videos are being shot in Bulawayo and the city’s outskirts by film production companies – Umqali Wendaba Films, Veins Media, Brooklyn Films and George Moyo. Due to the ban of public gatherings, Madlela said he has so much time on his hands as he has nothing else to do apart from producing music hence his decision to utilise this time by recording videos. “Apart from being in the studio, we have nothing that we’re doing currently as we aren’t staging shows. So I thought it wise for me to utilise this opportunity to have numerous visuals for my upcoming album,” the Ngamnanka hit-maker said. If all goes according to plan, two of the videos will be launched soon as a way to tease fans ahead of the album launch. “Two of the videos, I 50 duuu and Impi are set to be released before the launch of the album with one set to be dropped with the album and the others after.” The forthcoming album has a mixture of rhumba, tshibilika, Afro-jazz, house and gospel tunes. Other tracks are Karikiriki, Emasurbabsin featuring Awa, Hwabaraty and Bajilla, Khumbule Khaya and Tambai which features Bajila.
