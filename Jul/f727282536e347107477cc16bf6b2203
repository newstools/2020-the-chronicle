FAMED wheel spinner DJ Tira is being credited online for his consistency over the years after he dropped the visuals for Uyandazi, a track which features Zimbabwean songstress, Berita. The video which is available on YouTube has reached over 24 000 views following its release on Tuesday afternoon. With a setting at a beach in South Africa, Berita lightens up the start of the video with a seductive dress which shows off her clean thighs. The smiles that Berita puts out with her unidentified lover in the video blends well with that of DJ Tira and his unidentified lover. The scenes from the video purely resonate that of a couple surely in love and in need of romance as they shower each other with gifts. Commenting on the visuals, one Smanga Mthembu hailed Tira, who is celebrating 21 years in the industry, for his consistency and named him the greatest of all time. Edzatira Mbiza said: “Berita’s voice is so calming and soothing. Beautiful music andbeautiful video.
