UMZINGWANE legislator Levi Mayihlome and his wife Lethiwe have donated a beast to Highlanders that will be shared by players and coaches. The donation comes two months after Insiza North MP Farai Taruvinga gave the club $8  000 that was channelled towards salaries and 175kg of beef shared by players and the technical team. Bosso were left without a sponsor after principal backers NetOne terminated their deal and have been surviving on the goodwill of their followers. A group of supporters also sourced food hampers for the players. Local apostolic sect Johane Masowe weChishanu Selbourne Park were the first to lend a helping hand to Bosso when they responded to Bulawayo mayor Solomon Mguni’s call to assist local clubs that have been hit by the lockdown. The sect donated 600kg of mealie meal and rice. A fortnight ago, former national team captain Benjani Mwaruwari also donated food hampers to the club, with each player getting a 10kg bag of mealie meal and cooking oil. Highlanders spokesperson Ronald Moyo confirmed that the club got beef from the Mayihlomes, avid Highlanders followers. “We are glad to receive this gesture from Brig Gen (Rtd) Levi Mayihlome and Mrs Mayihlome. The MP and his family are ardent Highlanders fans and this is how far they have decided to show their support for the club. We really appreciate that,” Moyo said.
