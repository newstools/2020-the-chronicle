HIGHLANDERS’ annual mid-year review meeting is likely to be cancelled this year due to the novel Covid-19 pandemic that has paralysed sporting activities around the globe. While there is no constitutionally fixed date for the meeting, it has traditionally been held during mid-season to coincide with the Premier Soccer League break, which gives Highlanders’ members an opportunity to meet and review the club’s activities. A Highlanders executive committee member hinted to Chronicle Sport on the possibility of the meeting being frozen because protocols around the pandemic were extremely in favour of cancellation. “Look an official position is yet to be agreed, but indications are that the traditional mid-year meeting is unlikely to take place because the protocols around Covid-19 do not allow it. Remember also that this is ordinarily an EGM without a constitutionally fixed date, but traditionally held in mid-year to coincide with the PSL season break giving us an opportune time to review of club’s activities at the half way point. “We are at a point where the commencement of football is still not defined by the FA and only intimations suggest September as the possible start date. I am sure in a short while the club will issue a statement confirming the cancellation,” said the executive committee member.
