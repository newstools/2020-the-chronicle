WANKIE and Zimbabwe football legend Amos Rendo is awaiting blood transfusion at Hwange Colliery Hospital following a massive response to appeals for assistance for him to purchase blood at a cost of US$300. His blood level is at 3,3 grams per decilitre instead of between 13 and 16 grams per decilitre. A respected figure within the Hwange community, Rendo has been battling the condition since 2018. A cross section of good Samaritans, mainly from the Southern Region, heeded SOS calls from the 1975 Soccer Star of the Year finalist’s family after doctors told them that Rendo’s haemoglobin levels were critically low. A public appeal saw cash donations coming from concerned individuals, including politicians from the region, coaches, former and current players, football administrators as well as diasporans. By Thursday evening, over $10 000 and US$300 had been raised, a positive development that shows that once united, a community can do a lot for each other. Haemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. Oxygen entering the lungs attaches to the haemoglobin in the blood, which carries it to the tissues of the body. When someone has insufficient red blood cells or the ones they have do not work properly, the body is left short of the oxygen it needs to function. Low blood levels can cause heart failure and even death. Rendo played for Chipangano from the early 1960s before hanging up his boots just after independence. He was part of the 1970 and 1973 Chipangano side that lifted the prestigious Castle Cup. He also made it into the 1975 Soccer Stars of the Year finalists alongside other greats like George Shaya, Tymon Mabaleka, Posani Sibanda, Rodrick Simwanza, Oliver Kateya, Josiah Nxumalo, Herman Hendrickes, Daniel Chikanda, Billy Sharman and David Muchineripi.
