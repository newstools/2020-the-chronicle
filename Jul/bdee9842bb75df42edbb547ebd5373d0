SOUTH Africa-based musician Duduzile Ndlovu affectionately known as La Dee has joined Hillbrow Radio on a new show called “S’pheth Ez’shisayo” which will be held every Friday from 6pm to 8pm. The musician-cum radio presenter is set to get the people of Johannesburg mainly Hillbrow up for a Friday vibe with Zimbabweans contributing to the large number of residents in the suburb. Speaking from her base in Germiston in Gauteng province, La Dee said she will take the opportunity to market her fellow countrymen. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-503752" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/6D8BAA12-383D-435B-8E1C-8F9FEEF1BCD1.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/6D8BAA12-383D-435B-8E1C-8F9FEEF1BCD1.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/6D8BAA12-383D-435B-8E1C-8F9FEEF1BCD1-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
“I now host alone the a show called “S’pheth Ez’shisayo” on Fridays where I get to play and promote all kinds of music internationally. “Well having my own show in South Africa is an advantage as it will be easier to push, link and promote artistes back home and also in South Africa because we have great talent back at home that need exposure worldwide,” said La Dee. La Dee said it has been always a dream to venture into broadcasting and once have her own show. “I have hosted two shows so far and I feel like it’s been years doing this. I am happy the audience welcomed me with warm hearts,” she said. @mthabisi_mthire
