THE rise of the Zimbabwean hip-hop wave in the Matabeleland region was propelled by the gale that is rap in kwaito, a juggernaut genre that swept the whole country into a euphoric frenzy as artistes like Cal_Vin, Floppy X, GTI, Guluva 7 among others bloomed up. In Gwanda it has not been the same case as artistes are more inclined to genres that sell and with the coming on board of a trio outfit called Gud Fellaz, the music pace is set to be quite interesting as there are part of a few if any other kasi rap artistes in the mining town. Comprising of Wellington ‘Nazah’ Ncube, Prince ‘Skhanda’ Ndlovu and Thamsanqa ‘Nkalasto’ Nkala the group was formed in 2019 and is only becoming visible a year later after they dropped a single titled Gud Fellaz Anthem a fortnight ago. Speaking from their Gwanda base through their manager Kukhanyakwenkosi Zinti ‘Ganjah’ Mnkandhla, the group said they are working on a nine track album that will be released in mid August. “As a group we are former dancers and stage performers but now we want to bring a new vibe in the town by introducing kasi rap through our debut album which we recorded at X Studios, Village Records and PM Records and will have nine tracks namely Gud Fellaz, Muhleza, Daipop, Umuntu, Ispani, Beergorra, Questions, Mama and Holy Lord. “The inspiration came from a background that includes the spoken word and our songs are in IsiNdebele, Sotho, Tshangaan, English and Shona,” said Ganjah. There are many rap beefs that have rocked the genre from rhyme issues to random hissy fits and the evolving of a kasi rap outfit is likely to see the emergence of other parties in the game. @mthabisi_mthire
