MATABELELAND North Province will this weekend hold a two-day online chess tournament in remembrance of the late Vice-President Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo. Matabeleland North Chess Association chairman Kripo Chivhenge said due to Covid-19 restrictions, players will participate in the tournament from the comfort of their homes. Last year, the competition drew 300 participants from across the country as well as some Zambian players. Chivhenge said they are expecting at least 200 participants to register for the online edition. “As the chess fraternity, we decided to honour the late Vice-President Nkomo by naming the tournament after him to remember his legacy. We’ve been enjoying good corporate support since the introduction of the competition in 2017. Besides remembering our hero, the competition gives local players and foreign participants an opportunity to keep active, be exposed to high level of competition and earn points,” said Chivhenge. Tongoona Gumbo of Hwange won the inaugural edition, with Tapiwa Jele from Bulawayo crowned 2018 champion. Zambian Chola Musonda is the defending champion. Participants will compete in the open, ladies and Under-14 categories. The tournament will be played in the evening and once participants register, they will be given a password to enter the competition. Chivhenge, who is also the tournament director, said they’ll be strict on time. Some of the competition’s traditional sponsors include Kanondo Safaris, the Pulse Group, Project Chess Zimbabwe and ChessMates Academy. – @ZililoR
