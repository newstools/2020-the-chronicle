The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Through a drama series called Why Ladies Cheat which premiered last Thursday on the Pishavilla Communications YouTube page, women are discussing why they have multiple affairs. The first episode which was shot mostly in Bulawayo features award–winning actress and singer Qeqeshiwe “Qeqe” Mntambo and Glam Award founder and actor, Albert Prince Chigiya as special guests. In the eight-minute long episode, Linda Ndlovu who plays Eve, Shevonne Mlauzi as Shylet and Thabisile Ngwenya as Cassandra deliberate on the “right” man. They elaborate on the fact that a man’s beauty is in his cows which translates to wealth coming first in a relationship as love does not pay the bills. Eve and Casandra go on to tell Shylet that the new generation of girls should not wait for a man to make a move on them, advising her to declare her feelings for Chigiya. The second episode is expected to premiere tomorrow at 8pm with the special guest being rapper Cal Vin.
