A GWANDA man was arrested after he allegedly fatally stabbed his friend in a dispute over beer. Khumbulani Sibanda (29) from Zelezele Village in Guyu was not asked to plead when he appeared briefly before Gwanda magistrate, Miss Lerato Nyathi facing a murder charge. He was remanded in custody to July 24. Prosecuting, Miss Ethel Mahachi said Sibanda and Prince Moyo were drinking beer with friends at Takaliyawa Business Centre when a misunderstanding ensued Over whose turn it was to buy beer. “Moyo pointed out that it was Sibanda’s turn to buy more beer as he had bought the least among the whole group. “The group then turned on Sibanda and pressured him to buy more beer for them as he was just drinking without contributing any more. This didn’t go down well with Sibanda who denied that it was his turn to buy more beer. Sibanda turned on Moyo and they started arguing,” she said. Miss Mahachi said Sibanda produced an okapi knife and stabbed Moyo two times on the chest. She said their friends intervened and stopped Sibanda from attacking Moyo further. Miss Mahachi said Moyo was rushed to the nearest clinic where he was declared dead upon arrival while Sibanda fled from the scene. She said the matter was reported to the police who conducted investigations resulting in the arrest of the accused person. She said a blood-stained knife which is suspected to have been used to commit the offence was recovered in the house of the accused person as well as blood stained clothes. @DubeMatutu
