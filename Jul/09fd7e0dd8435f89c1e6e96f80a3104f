THE coronavirus pandemic has derailed many planned athletics events worldwide, and the heartbreak of race cancellations and postponements is being felt by runners everywhere. Those that had spent months training for anything from their first 5km to an ultramarathon are struggling to adjust to the abrupt change in plans. But rather than letting the goals of countless runners go unfulfilled, some race sponsors are saying the show must proceed, even if it means going virtual. Old Mutual Women’s Network (OWN) Zimbabwe Chapter will today and tomorrow hold a Virtual Marathon whose proceeds will be donated to some local families that have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. OWN Zimbabwe Chapter is made up of women employed by Old Mutual Zimbabwe Limited and seek to make a positive impact within Old Mutual and the community in which the organisation operates in. In an events profile-raiser on the Old Mutual Facebook page, OWN Zimbabwe Chapter president Kudakwashe Muswaka said: “On the 4th and 5th of July, we will be hosting a Virtual Marathon and all proceeds will be donated to charity for the benefit of Zimbabwean families affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.” The Virtual Marathon, which will be held under the theme, Help Feed A Family, will have 5km,10km ,21km and 42km races and is open to anyone in the world. Runners will have the opportunity to put their disciplined training to use, with the added convenience of completing their race mileage right where they are. It will work like most virtual races, as participants will select a distance and their own route, sign up and pay the registration fee. Participation fees are $50 or US$5. Muswaka said that Under-12 contestants should be accompanied by adults from start to finish in any of the races they choose. She also said all contestants will receive Certificates of Participation and the runners will be expected to record and report their results.
