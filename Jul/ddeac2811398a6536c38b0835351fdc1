ACTING Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo province chairperson Joseph Nkomazana says plans for the introduction of a Division Two league in the city are on course despite the Covid-19 setback. Initially the Division Two league was meant to kick-off in March, but the Covid-19 pandemic forced the cessation of all sporting activities in the country. The idea behind the new league is to enhance competition in the game. Despite sponsorship challenges that teams are likely to face, the league will also give upcoming talented girls a chance to showcase their talent. “At the moment the executive is working on setting up a Division Two league in Bulawayo. We were already recieving interest from a number of teams that want to be part of this project. Provincially, the setup has teams from the Masiye Netball League, Christian Netball League and Prevention Netball League. “Those are social teams which we communicate with on a weekly basis through our online meetings and we are hoping they will be part of the Division Two League,” said Nkomazana. He stated that they were targeting about 20 teams for the new league. The Zina provincial executive led by Ruth Hove was elected at the beginning of this year and is pushing for this project to be a success. Cindy Mutero is the vice-secretary, while Jabulani Manga is the fixtures secretary, with Skhululiwe Mabhena and Prosper Mubaiwa as treasurer and organiser respectively. Committee members consist of Mthokozisi Gambu, Matriona Sibanda and lshumael Banda. According to the Sports and Recreation Commission, netball is a high risk sport and cannot yet resume activities. With the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, sport in general is likely to remain on the sidelines for a while. – @innocentskizoe.
