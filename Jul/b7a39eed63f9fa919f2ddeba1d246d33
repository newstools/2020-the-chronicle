BULAWAYO Provincial Karate Association chairperson Sensei Ndabezinhle Mazibuko says they are pinning thier hopes on the Sports and Recreation Commission allowing resumption of non-contact training soon. Mazibuko said there has not been much work in the province as they await the SRC to give them the greenlight to resume activities. “We are yet to meet as the provincial association, as we are waiting for the SRC response to the Zimbabwe Karate Union’s application to resume non-contact training,” said Mazibuko. ZKU applied to the SRC seeking approval to practice non-contact training and competition. “We shall limit our training to only kata and kihon where there is absolutely no physical contact between instructors and athletes. Kata and kihon training are done through social Iearning (observing and imitating what the instructor is demonstrating). Competition will be limited to kata alone. There shall be no physical contact among athletes,” reads parts of ZKU’s letter to the SRC. ZKU says it has taken time to familiarise itself with the World Health Organisation considerations for sports federations/sports event organisers when planning mass gatherings in the context of Covid-19 as well as provisions and requirements of the regulations. They have also consulted widely with members and are satisfied that karate can be practiced in a non-contact form as a lower risk sport where physical distancing is possible, just like in archery, shooting and other athletics events. — @innocentskizoe.
