THE Zimbabwe Karate Union (ZKU) is working towards ensuring the martial arts is included in the mainstream education system as part of efforts to develop and upgrade the sport. According to a memo addressed to all ZKU style heads and branch chiefs, they are required to submit the syllabi of their styles by end of day tomorrow. “The ZKU national executive is currently in liaison with the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) for the inclusion of karate in the mainstream education system. “The ZKU has been requested to urgently submit a karate curriculum for consideration. Because each style has its own unique syllabus, we instantly require the input of all style heads for us to come up with a curriculum that will be comprehensive and that will apply to all bona fide styles of the ZKU. “May each Style Head/Branch Chief submit the syllabi of their styles by Saturday 4 July 2020 to the Secretary General (secretariat@zimkarate.org) to enable the executive committee to draft an all styles encompassing karate curriculum for submission to the SRC during the week ending 10 July 2020. Kindly take note that those styles that shall fail to submit the requested syllabi shall be excluded from the karate curriculum for schools,” reads the ZKU memo. Meanwhile, the ZKU has put in place a projects committee to help raise funds for teams on national duty. The committee to be led by George Maposa as chairperson, will include the ZKU legal, marketing and media personnel and a representative from the secretariat. The committee will be responsible for resource mobilisation for national teams. — @innocentskizoe
