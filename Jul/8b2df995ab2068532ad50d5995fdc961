The Chronicle THE Premier League has confirmed when the transfer window will open and close this summer, after initial plans were significantly altered by the coronavirus crisis. With the season now running until a conclusion on July 26, the transfer window will open after the final games of the campaign. The start date of the 2020/21 Premier League season is not yet confirmed, with the weekend of September 12 looking most likely, but there remains the possibility that it could start earlier than this. If the Premier League does get back underway on September 12, it will mean there will be around three weeks between the start of the season and the close of the transfer window, and then 11 more days of a domestic-only window. A Premier League statement read: “Premier League Shareholders have agreed on the dates for the summer 2020 transfer window. The window will open for 10 weeks at the end of the current Premier League season, starting on 27 July and ending on 5 October. Following consultation with the EFL, a domestic-only window will be added from 5 October, closing 17:00 BST on 16 October. During this window, Premier League clubs will only be able to trade with EFL clubs (either loans or permanent registrations). No transfers can take place between Premier League clubs in this period. The transfer window is subject to the approval of Fifa.” The EFL’s window will run for the same dates of July 27 to October 5, with the extended domestic-only window afterwards. – Metro.co.uk
