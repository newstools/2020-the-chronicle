GWANDA-based musician Master Zhoe is putting final touches on his fifth album titled Gwenyambira which features collaborations with Nicholas “Madzibaba” Zacharia and Bazooka. The musician went all out in order to appease his fans after having ample time due to the lockdown to work on the 20-track album at his co-owned X Studios music label studio. Of the tracks, two of them namely Ndiwe and Sanyeperwe which features Zimdancehall chanter Bazooka were dropped early this year, while the other tracks are a solo ride except, Mazuva, which features veteran Zachariah, known as the Senior Lecturer. Other tracks which were all produced by fast rising producer DJ Drumz are namely Rova Ngoma, Handiende, Kunozorora, Chiro, Naija dance 2, Ngirozi, Uchava wangu, Kuzofara, Babie, Feeling gud, I’m your hero, Nayja, The love, My gal, Simudza, Vegodo and Ngimthandile. Speaking from Gwanda, Master Zhoe through his assistant manager Morateoa Sidange said the album is a reflection of his growth in the music scene. “The album’s name Gwenyambira is a title for someone who is good with instruments hence the 20 songs showcasing instrumental literacy. “It has a collaboration with Madzibaba in order to meet that standard as he is known to be one of the greatest instrumentalists,” said Sidange, whose artiste recently celebrated his 35th birthday. He said the album will be launched only if public gatherings are permitted. “We want to launch the album on a street network where it’s going to be an event where we interact with our fans and have talks and hear what they expect from us and all as a label too. “So only when gatherings are permitted will we release the album and let the fans enjoy it like never before,” she said. Sidange said they are working on a video for the track Mazuva. — @mthabisi_mthire.
