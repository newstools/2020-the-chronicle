THE number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country which has surpassed the 2 000 mark, more than doubled within just nine days. On Wednesday this week, 214 more people tested positive in Zimbabwe, most of them being returnees from South Africa. On Thursday, 90 more were recorded which brings the cumulative total to 2 124. So far 28 people have succumbed to the virus. The country recorded its first 1 000 cases last week on Monday and nine days later, the figure had doubled. Mpilo Central Hospital acting chief executive officer Professor Solwayo Ngwenya said the numbers will continue to rise as long as people do not comply with lockdown regulations. He said people should desist from visiting the city centre and all public places. “The best way for us to beat this virus is to prevent it. Our resources are really stretched and we will not be able to cope with huge numbers of Covid-19 cases. We will definitely record more cases as long as people violate lockdown regulations,” said Prof Ngwenya.
