ALROSA Zimbabwe (Alrosa Zim), a joint venture between Russia’s leading diamond producer, Alrosa and the country’s State-owned miner, the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company, has started prospecting and preliminary exploration works for primary diamond deposits in Matabeleland region and Masvingo province. In 2019, the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) and Alrosa signed agreements to finalise the creation of a joint venture (JV) to prospect and explore diamond  deposits locally. The project is one of the many investments under the Second Republic that President Mnangagwa has endorsed to reignite the economy after close to two decades of stagnation. Alrosa deputy chief executive officer Mr Vladimir Marchenko said in a statement that  after securing special grants from the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development, Alrosa Zim had the environmental-impact assessment (EIA) approved by the Environmental Management Agency (EMA). He said this paved way for prospecting and exploration in the Masvingo, Matebeleland South and Matebeleland North provinces.
