The collaboration between two internet sensations, up-and-coming Zimdancehall artiste Van Choga and the G.O.A.T aka AY Poyoo came as a joke but their song, Ghetto Rules is actually a banger. The single was released on Tuesday morning and within an hour of its release, it had already garnered over 12 000 views. Judging from comments thus far, fans of the two fast-rising artistes are impressed and are now eagerly waiting for a video of the song as well as a concert once lockdown restrictions are lifted. Like AY Poyoo always says, people may want to “washout” (watch out) for the two musicians as they seem very determined to run the show at a time some more established artistes are hibernating. Have a listen and share your thoughts with us.
