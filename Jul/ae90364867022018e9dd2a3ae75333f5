THE countdown for the launch of Afro-pop musician Mzoe 7’s Amapiano track Asambeni has reached fever pitch with the picturesque visuals expected to be out by Saturday. The visuals were shot by Keaitse Films with the assistance of Ralph with Rasquesity as the director of photography and George Moyo as set assistant. With the Asambeni video, Mzoe 7 seeks to leave an indelible mark through the African touch on the video which was captured by its setting in the ghetto and outskirts of Bulawayo. If the artiste will achieve such will only be known in four days’ time. Fans are however hopeful that Mzoe 7 will develop the city’s music scene into one that has outstanding videos. In the past, artistes in the capital were the only ones who won gongs for exquisite videos, something artistes from the Matabeleland region want to change as they have moved from their comfort zone and are also producing quality videos. Mzoe 7 said he hopes the Asambeni music video will be considered for airplay on international channels like Channel O and MTV Base.
