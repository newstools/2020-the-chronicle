ORGANISERS of the Creative Diversity and Social Inclusion (Credisi) concert have proved that they have a listening ear after giving artistes who had been recommended by fans, slots at this month’s virtual show. These are Mawiza, Skaiva, Mandy Mae (Badgyal), Fish F Ndaramu and Sithandazile Dube. Organised by Iyasa, the monthly show which is meant to bring artistes from Bulawayo closer to their audiences, will be held next Friday from 8.30PM on the Iyasa and CNC Facebook pages. Event organiser, Iyasa director – Nkululeko Dube said the line-up is a clear example of their motive of showcasing the diverse talent in the city. “This month’s line up is informed by feedback we got from our previous edition. These are artistes people advised us to give a chance and we did just that,” Dube said. “It’s important to emphasise that Credisi is not a commercial venture. It’s an opportunity provided by Culture At Work Africa through Iyasa and the City Council of Bulawayo to provide a platform for local artistes to have space to show how diverse and rich our creativity is,” he said. Dube said they will continue unearthing up-and-coming artistes in the city. “It’s (Credisi) like a window to the city’s up-and-coming and established artistes,” he said. With artistes still unable to stage shows due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown, platforms like Credisi are giving artistes a rare platform to showcase their works and establish new audiences. – @mthabisi_mthire.
