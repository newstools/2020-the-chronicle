THE Covid-19 death toll has jumped to 13 following the death of three people in Harare on Thursday and one person from Matabeleland North yesterday as confirmed cases climbed to 942. Harare leads in the national Covid-19 death toll with six people having succumbed to the virus. On Thursday, 41 new Covid-19 cases were recorded, 36 of them local transmissions while 16 more were recorded on Friday. The three new deaths at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital and Parirenyatwa Hospitals were posthumously confirmed. The Ministry of Health and Child Care daily report of July 9, said from the 51 cases recorded in Bulawayo on Wednesday, 21 of them were health workers and 18 of them work at the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH). “To date the total number of confirmed cases is 942 including 320 recovered, 609 active cases, and 13 deaths since the onset of the outbreak on March 20 2020,” reads the report. UBH acting chief executive officer Dr Narcissus Dzvanga said in light of escalating Covid-19 cases, members of the public should adhere to laid down prevention measures including wearing of masks. He said the country is expected to start recording increased cases due to the winter season. “People should take due caution. I’m one advocate for wearing a mask at all times not just in public places. Hand hygiene plays a big role in the control of this virus. It’s a winter virus and this is the time for it to raise its ugly head. It’s worrying that it is affecting our staff but this is where we are supposed to find it. It was going to be more deadly if we are to find such numbers in the community. But if it is in a treatment centre, this is one of the occupational risks that are there and we have to rise and ensure that there is appropriate PPEs,” he said. — @nqotshili
