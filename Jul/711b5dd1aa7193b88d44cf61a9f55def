THE National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) will hold a virtual meeting this week to discuss the staging of inter-provincial championships in Bulawayo among other things. There are no confirmed dates for the event but it is tentatively set for August or September if all health and safety measures for a return to competitions are met. “We will be having a Naaz half year meeting via Zoom this Friday where we will discuss the issue of inter-provincials and the resumption of all other competitions. “We are busy with the logistics so that we are not found wanting when we restart. “We want to ensure that all safety precautions are met before we can hold our events. “Athletes should continue to keep themselves fit for the next competition. They should practise good hygiene and eat healthy foods as well as follow all health guidelines. “They should also train hard in preparation for commencement of active competition,” said a Naaz official. Athletics is among sport disciplines deemed low risk sports by the Sports and Recreation Commission, and has been given the green light to resume activities. Only track activities have been allowed to resume while field events remain suspended. — @innocentskizoe
