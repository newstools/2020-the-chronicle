A 19-YEAR-OLD teenager has been arrested after he allegedly killed his neighbour during a dispute over age difference. Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the incident which occurred in Colleen Bawn on Sunday at around 8PM. He said Herbert Jamara who works at Sally Mine in Colleen Bawn had a dispute with Mr Abel Mbomo over their ages. Kudakwashe Dube intervened and Jamara struck him with a brick on the head. “Kudakwashe Dube was at his home drinking beer with his friends when Jamara arrived and joined them. Jamara then had a misunderstanding with Mr Abel Mbomo over who was older and who had the most strength. Jamara then threatened to assault Mr Mbomo and Dube intervened and rebuked Jamara for his actions,” he said. Chief Insp Ndebele said Jamara then turned on Dube and threatened to assault him. He said Jamara went outside and returned shortly with a brick and struck Dube several times on the head before fleeing the scene. Dube was rushed to Gwanda Provincial Hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. Chief Insp Ndebele said the matter was reported to the police who conducted investigations leading to Jamara’s arrest. — @DubeMatutu
