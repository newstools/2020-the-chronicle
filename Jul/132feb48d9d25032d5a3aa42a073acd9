MATABELELAND North Volleyball Association chairperson Sifiso Buhlungu says they have begun ground work for the introduction of beach and sitting volleyball in the province. Zimbabwe is generally exposed to the formal 6-a-side version of volleyball, but beach volleyball and sitting volleyball are growing in popularity both as recreational and competitive sports. Beach volleyball is popular in Harare and more recently in Bulawayo where a few tournaments were held last year. Sitting volleyball, also known as Paralympic volleyball, is a form of volleyball for athletes that are physically challenged. At the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) annual general meeting held in Matabeleland North early this year, it was resolved that all provinces should adopt beach and sitting volleyball. “One key issue that we are looking at as the provincial association is the introduction of beach volleyball in the province. We want to start introducing it at school level where we have targeted the Under-14 age group before we move to the senior teams,” Buhlungu said. He said they were working tirelessly to ensure that Matabeleland North becomes a force in volleyball circles by growing the game from the grassroots level. He said primary schools in the province were not doing well at national level and there was therefore need to ensure the sport is played throughout the year as opposed to just the second term. “We are hoping to train beach coaches for all districts coaches as well as teachers in schools. The association will also be organising refresher courses for all our coaches and referees so that beach volleyball is played professionally,” he said. — @innocentskizoe
