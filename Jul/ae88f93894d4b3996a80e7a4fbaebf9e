THE Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) is hoping its players will benefit from the Covid-19 relief package launched by government to help athletes. Government, through the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation, unveiled a $10 million package aimed at assisting sportspersons during the lockdown. BVA secretary-general Munyaradzi Chigudu said the welfare of players during this long layoff is of much importance and they were in the process of helping players apply for the funds. “Over the past weeks we have engaged our players’ commission, which is leading assisting players that have been affected by this covid-19 situation. The commission is helping players apply for relief funds. The commission is also spearheading the process of identifying players that have been largely affected by this situation and are in need of assistance,” Chigudu said. In January the BVA enlisted various committees into its structures, as it seeks to make its brand more marketable and reach out to stakeholders more effectively. These include the referees commission, marketing commission, players commission, gender commission and social corporate affairs commission. “We have also engaged the social corporate affairs commission which is in the process of creating some short clips, audios and messages to raise the Covid-19 awareness on social media. These will also help update people with what is happening in volleyball and sports,” said Chigudu. He further stated that the association was constantly conducting online meetings and the next one is set for next week.
