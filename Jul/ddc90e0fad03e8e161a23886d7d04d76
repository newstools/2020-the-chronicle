The Chronicle Steven Gerrad has explained how Luis Suarez showed  “no respect” for anyone at Liverpool during training, including seasoned pros such as Jamie Carragher. The Uruguayan forward joined the Reds in 2011, by which time Gerrard and Carragher were the established heads of the dressing room in their roles as captain and vice-captain respectively. Suarez was still yet to prove himself on the grand stage as he arrived from Ajax, but Gerrard recalled how he was impressed from his first sessions with the player. “A lot of strikers that we used to sign did have respect for the likes of Jamie Carragher and other names around the squad but he (Luis Suarez) had no respect for anyone in training, in a good way,” he said on BBC Sounds’ Match of the Day: Top 10 podcast. Suarez had been one of two players signed as a replacement for departed fan favourite Fernando Torres, but remarkably was the cheaper of the two new arrivals. Liverpool forked out £22million for Suarez, but broke their transfer record to land Andy Carroll for £35million from Newcastle. While Carroll failed to hit the heights expected of him, Suarez was an instant hit with his bullish style.Adding further on the forward’s training manner, Gerrard said: “He’d be backing into them (teammates), he’d be leaving a bit in on them, he’d have elbows up and I’d be thinking that’s not normally what you’d see in training. “You’d normally see a lot of respect but Luis would run through anyone and have a defender up the wall at any given moment. “You knew straight away in days rather than weeks that he was going to be a top player for Liverpool.” Suarez went on to win the PFA Player of the Year award in the 2013/14 season, when Liverpool went agonisingly close to ending the club’s title wait. His impact on that side was clear, with Gerrard saying previously: “The arrival of him took us to the next level. The best player pound-for-pound I’ve played with.” – Mirror.co.uk
