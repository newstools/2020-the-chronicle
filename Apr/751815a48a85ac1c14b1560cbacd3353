On Friday proprietors were supposed to visit Thorngrove Infectious Disease Hospital, but saw it best to meet Bulawayo City Council (BCC) representatives at their council health department offices to discuss what to do with what they have collected. After the meeting, Phathisani Nkomo who is coordinating the donations said they would await the BCC to give them a list of what is needed as from today. “We’ve put in motion that any urgent payments will be channelled through us as long as it’s within our budget we will pay. The council will send us a list to buy starting Monday. At the meeting the industry was represented by Tony Msopero, Mike Nkolomi and myself,” said Nkomo. He said as a sector they were ready to help in the fight against Covid-19. Thorngrove Infectious Disease Hospital, earmarked to cater for Covid-19 cases in the city, is still undergoing renovations and in the event of a reported case in  the city, the patient has to be transferred to Harare for isolation. The revelations were made by the Minister of Local Government and Public Works, July Moyo at a Press conference after a meeting between a delegation from the Inter-Ministerial Taskforce on Covid-19 and members of the Beautiful Bulawayo Trust on Saturday night. The Trust, a committee formed to spearhead the fight against Covid-19 in the city has been given one week to set up a testing and isolation centre after it emerged yesterday that Bulawayo has no such facility. Last week, Thorngrove Infectious Diseases Hospital received a food consignment from Thuthuka Matabeleland Trust, surgical masks from an initiative called Bulawayo Babies while Chloride Zimbabwe said they would install solar power at the isolation ward. Rainbow Hotel also donated 300 pieces of linen including sheets and towels.
