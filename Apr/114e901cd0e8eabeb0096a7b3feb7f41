UP-and-coming gospel musician Uncle Shepp (real name Shepard Mutsata Maphosa) has released a single on coronavirus to reach out and educate people on the pandemic. The song titled Kukonda Corona is already receiving airplay on local radio stations at a time the country is on lockdown in an attempt to counter the spread of the virus. Uncle Shepp who is based in Beitbridge said the single which also has a music video was released last Monday, Day One of the country’s 21-day lockdown. It was recorded at Genuine Studios in Beitbridge with the video that is available on YouTube, being shot by Photozone in the border town. He said what motivated him to record this single was the realisation that most Zimbabweans were ignorant and in denial of the effects of this deadly virus that has killed  over 55 000 people and infected over a million people worldwide. In Zimbabwe, it has infected 9 people so far with one death being recorded. “Having realised the ignorance of our people, I saw the need as an artiste to educate and inform them about this virus that is killing thousands of people daily. The song seeks to make them realise how much they need to take the pandemic seriously. Washing our hands and preventing touching our faces is the way to go and I capture this on the song,” said Uncle Shepp. The song starts with lyrics “thousands are falling and many are dying” to highlight how the virus is a pandemic and a cause for concern. Producer of the song, Psaltz said: “I made the song catchy so that it has an impact on people such that they sing along to it and become mandated to act. As a country, we should work together and fight one enemy which is Covid-19.” – @mthabisi_mthire.
