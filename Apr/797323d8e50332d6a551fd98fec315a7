THE Warriors’ pair of defensive midfielder Butholezwe Ncube and winger Talent Chawapiwa could become the first Zimbabwean footballers in South Africa to feel the economic effects of coronavirus, following reports that salary cuts are inevitable at their club. The duo are in the books of Durban side AmaZulu, who are reported to have indicated that the suspension of league games due to Covid-19 has affected their operations. The South African Premiership, which is home to a number of Zimbabwe national team players, was forced to cancel its programme in March when first cases of coronavirus were recorded in that country. Even major global leagues like the English Premiership, La Liga of Spain, Italy’s Serie A and the French topflight cancelled their competitions on recommendations of the World Health Organisation. South Africa’s Soccer Laduma revealed yesterday that AmaZulu are facing financial challenges and will be effecting salary cuts for its employees, who include players and support staff. <img class="wp-image-452139 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Butholezwe-Ncube-180819-LooksOn-BPP-1050-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Butholezwe-Ncube-180819-LooksOn-BPP-1050.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Butholezwe-Ncube-180819-LooksOn-BPP-1050-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Butholezwe Ncube The club’s general manager Lunga Sokhela said: “In our industry, we have not been given any direction by the PSL regarding the re-opening of the season. The impact of Covid-19 has unfortunately severely affected us. “I did make it clear in the last letter, that even though the club receives the PSL grant and has Spar as a sponsor, it still relies on other income streams and significant contribution from the owners of the club whose businesses have been severely affected by Covid-19. “For the end of this month I can confirm that the company cannot pay salaries in full. Every effort has been made by the relevant parties to avoid this but unfortunately, they have not yielded positive results. We will advise by Wednesday, 22 April the effects this will have on your salaries.” South African Premiership clubs are cushioned with a monthly R2 million grant that the league reportedly continues to pay during the lockdown. AmaZulu are said to have applied to the Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (TERS) for assistance with unpaid leave and if successful, employees will each get a payout between R3 500 and R6 700. “We are going through hard times and these realities are not ideal. I advise those that have obligations with creditors to contact them for relief to ease the burden it will have on your personal cashflows,” added the AmaZulu’s chief. Zimbabwean footballers in the South African Premiership, who could be affected include the quartet of goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda, left-back Divine Lunga, defensive midfielder Danny Phiri and striker Knox Mutizwa, who play for AmaZulu’s neighbours, Golden Arrows. Kudakwashe Mahachi (Supersport United), Ronald Pfumbidzayi (Bloemfontein Celtic), the Highlands Park pair of Tapiwa Kapini and Tendai Ndoro, Polokwane City’s George Chigova and Elvis Chipezeze of Baroka are some of the national team footballers in South Africa. Even players in major European leagues are taking salary cuts as their clubs try to survive during the Covid-19 lockdown. — @ZililoR.
