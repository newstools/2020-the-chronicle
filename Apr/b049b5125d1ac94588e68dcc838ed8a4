AFTER turning out for 19 local teams, pint sized attacking midfielder Golden Munandi has decided to hang his football boots. Munandi (35), a former FC Platinum, CAPS United, Black Rhinos, Triangle, Border Strikers and Zimbabwe Saints player, says he regrets that football only gave him fame and friends without fortune. “For the past 18 years, I enjoyed playing local football. However, I regret that I only got fame and friends from playing the game for 19 local clubs,” said the easy-going former player. He also had playing stints at FC Windemere, Bulawayo Chiefs, Shangani Mine, ZPC Munyati, Piggot Maskew and most recently at Filabusi United in the lower rungs of Zimbabwean football. “For the past 18 years, I enjoyed playing local football. I was so nomadic all in search of greener pastures but here I am, now a former footballer who is selling chocolate sweets which I import from South Africa,” said Munandi at his family home in Bulawayo’s high-density suburb of Cowdray Park. He says his best coaches were the late Gishon Ntini and legendary Moses Chunga. The pint-sized former midfielder is one of the many uncelebrated players who helped Zimbabwe’s league champions earn Premier Soccer League promotion in 2010. He speaks of a trail of broken dreams and broken promises by Pure Platinum Play. “With the great work I did for the team since our days in the lower divisions, the treatment that I got from them at the end of the day was a slap in the face,” said Munandi. He says he is still seething over an unfairly terminated contract, “unpaid signing-on fees and compensation for contract termination.”
