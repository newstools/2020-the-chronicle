PLAYERS selected to represent Zimbabwe at international squash tournaments have been given fitness programmes to follow during the Covid-19 lockdown to prepare for future competitions. A number of major competitions have been put on ice due to the coronavirus pandemic which has hit the entire globe. Events cancelled by World Squash Federation that were scheduled for April are the Texas Open set for Houston in America, Pakistan’s Chief of Air Staff International, Oceania Junior Championships in Australia, Irish Open and Egypt’s El Gouna Open. Lucky Mlilo, Zimbabwe Squash president, is hopeful that the spread of coronavirus will be contained in time for South Africa’s Inter-Provincial Championships set for July. “We were lucky that we held our Mashonaland Junior championships, Matabeleland Junior championships and Zimbabwe Junior Championships in March before the lockdown. “We have the SA Inter-Provincials in July and we are not sure if they will be held. The World Junior Squash Championships scheduled for Gold Coast, Australia, in July have been cancelled. “The World Squash Masters in August in Poland are doubtful although the World Squash Federation has not said anything so far. “What we’ve simply done is to have those selected for national teams doing fitness programmes during this lockdown,” said Mlilo. — @ZililoR.
