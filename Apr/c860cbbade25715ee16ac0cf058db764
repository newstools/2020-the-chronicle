ONE of Zimbabwe’s megastores, Fazak Home and Hyper, has introduced a virtual shopping model to ensure continued service to customers while mitigating against the spread of Covid-19. The pandemic which was first detected in China last December, has since spread across the globe killing thousands of people. Zimbabwe which has 25 confirmed cases and three deaths from the pandemic, has been on a 21-day national lockdown since March 30 as part of measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. In a public notice to its customers, the Bulawayo-based one stop shopping retailer said: “Due to the circumstances and out of consideration for the wellbeing of our staff as well as the community at large, we wish to advise that Fazak Home and Hyper will be running a virtual store.” The retail outlet, which among others offers a hypermarket, butchery, furniture and appliances said this means that during the national lockdown period its doors would remain closed but it had opened up dedicated mobile phone numbers on social media for customers’ convenience. “What this means, in essence, is that we will be closing our doors to the general public and offering you, our loyal customer an opportunity to place orders with us,” said Fazak Home and Hyper. Orders may also be placed using e-mail with clients having an option to either collect their orders from the retailer or for a nominal fee where their goods would be delivered at their respective residential addresses. “We accept all forms of payment and orders may be paid in advance or upon collection or delivery. — @okazunga
