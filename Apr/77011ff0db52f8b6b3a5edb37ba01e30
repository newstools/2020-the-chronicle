Midlands province yesterday received an initial batch of 200 rapid-result test kits from the Government, a major boost in the fight against the spread of Covid-19. Government is targeting to test at least 40 000 people by the end of April and has widened the criteria to include all patients with fever admitted at hospitals countrywide, Government employees reporting for duty and all persons working during the lockdown interfacing with the community. Law enforcement agents, employees of service providers such as retail business, petrol attendants and food outlets, health care workers in the frontline, those working for infectious diseases hospitals, provincial and district hospitals as well as private institutions are also going to be tested. Midlands Provincial Medical Director Dr Reginald Mhene confirmed the development during the Midlands Covid-19 Taskforce feedback meeting held yesterday. “We have received the first batch of the rapid-result kits from Government aimed at promoting mass testing as part of efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19,” he said. Dr Mhene said to date there hasn’t been any confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the province. “As of April 15, Midlands province tested 13 suspects and they all tested negative. Of these Kwekwe had five, Zvishavane and Chirumhanzu two each, Gweru three and Gokwe North one,” he said. Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs Larry Mavima Midlands commended Government for delivering the rapid-result test kits in time. “We would like to thank the Government for increasing the availability of rapid-result test kits. We were worried that we could not test our people and it’s good to know that we have this huge support from Government which is reaching out to a wider population,” he said.
