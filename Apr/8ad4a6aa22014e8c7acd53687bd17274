SOUTH Africa-based former Highlanders winger Gabriel Nyoni yesterday made an impassioned plea to his fellow footballers to appreciate work done by frontline health workers risking their lives during the global Covid-19 pandemic. Nyoni, who turns out for Premiership side Maritzburg United, dispelled the notion that footballers are heroes, expressing his “heartfelt” gratitude to all essential staff that are helping out during the lockdown. “Football players, do we now understand that we are entertainers and not heroes. When the world goes back to its beautiful original state, let’s respect every fan. Some of them are nurses, doctors, defence force personnel, who are risking their lives right now to save ours,” wrote Nyoni on his Twitter timeline. Health workers continue to risk their lives, serving communities’ needs by providing care to coronavirus victims. Even with limited personal protective equipment, frontline workers have been putting their lives on the line. Highlanders chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube marveled at Nyoni’s advice, tweeting: “Your wisdom will kill someone GN27.” Dube’s club is running a crowd funding campaign to harness resources to be channeled to Ekusileni Hospital, a treatment centre for Covid-19 cases. Bosso players have also been sending out social media messages encouraging people to adhere to the Government’s directives to stay at home during the lockdown. Nyoni, who calls himself “Zimbabwe’s own football technocrat”, has also been sharing training tips on his Twitter timeline. — @ZililoR.
