A BINGA man who was found in possession of a pangolin and claimed Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) rangers and police set him up, has been ordered to perform community service at a local police station. Cleopas Dube (38) of Bazingili Village under Chief Siabuwa had pleaded not guilty to possessing a pangolin when he appeared before Binga magistrate Mrs Portia Mhlanga-Moyo. Through his lawyer Mr Knowledge Dingani of Mvhiringi and Associates, Dube told the court that the pangolin was brought to him by the anti-poaching team of rangers and police. The magistrate found Dube guilty and sentenced him to two years in jail before suspending six months on condition of good behavior in the next five years. Dube was however spared the agony of jail life after the magistrate further suspended the remaining 18 months on condition that he completes 620 hours of community service at Binga Police Station starting yesterday. Prosecuting Mr Quiet Mpofu said Dube was found selling the pangolin for US$1 000. “On the 24th day of September 2019, Mr Tarisayi Kwembeya, a ranger from Zimparks received a tip-off to the effect that the accused was in possession of a live pangolin which he was selling for US$1 000. Rangers teamed up with police and contacted Dube through a cellphone pretending to be buyers,” said Mr Mpofu. He said Dube, who was in the company of an accomplice directed the anti-poaching team to a place along the Siabuwa-Mujeri road in Bhombodube village. Dube and the alleged accomplice who is still at large brought the pangolin in a cardboard box and handed it over to Mr Kwembeya whom they assumed to be a buyer. However, Dube and his alleged accomplice became suspicious and fled from the scene before they could be given the money, the court was told. The duo left the pangolin behind. Dube was arrested in February while his alleged accomplice is still on the run. — @ncubeleon
