Artistes in Gwanda have partnered with the community in a bid to fight malaria following an outbreak which has so far killed two people in the district. Mthabisi Dube who is among those behind the initiative, said his group – Bolamba Performing Arts together with Jahunda Community Arts and Gwanda South villagers were mobilising funds to fight malaria as well as Covid-19. “As the community of Gwanda South and local artistes, we came up with an initiative of fighting malaria and also disseminating information on Covid-19 after realising that we are faced with a double tragedy. “There is an outbreak of malaria in the constituency and so far two people have been killed by the epidemic,” said Dube. He said because people lacked information, many people believed the two deaths were as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The malaria outbreak has caused panic in the community with some people thinking that those who died succumbed to Covid-19 as some of the symptoms are similar. We’re therefore trying to mobilise resources to fund awareness campaigns,” Dube said. Matabeleland South province has this year recorded an increase in malaria cases with eight deaths being recorded in Gwanda South and Beitbridge districts over the past two months. The Provincial Medical Director, Dr Rudo Chikodzore said the province has recorded more than 1 000 malaria cases since January. – @DubeMatutu
