SENSEI Ndabezinhle Mazibuko has joined a host of sport personalities and associations that are encouraging people to stay at home during the 21-day lockdown for their safety. As governments throughout the world enforce lockdowns and encourage their citizens to stay at home to prevent further spread of Covid-19, the Bulawayo Metropolitan Karate Association (BMKA) has urged residents to stay at home and be safe. Mazibuko, the BMKA chairman, said it was better to be safe than sorry. “We’ve urged members to train in private, otherwise they must follow all coronavirus protocols. We were meant to have our annual general meeting this month, but will have to postpone it as we will still be under lockdown. Tournament dates had not yet been finalised, so we will be adjusting the dates when the situation is back to normal,” said Mazibuko. He has been leading by example by posting exercise videos daily on social media since the lockdown. President Mnangagwa declared a 21-day lockdown which started on Monday as part of measures to curb the spread of Covid-19, which has killed more than 40 000 people worldwide and infected nearly a million. Zimbabwe has recorded eight confirmed Covid-19 cases and one death. — @innocentskizoe.
