THE Midlands Provincial Covid-19 Taskforce committee has allowed fresh produce farmers to sell directly to consumers as opposed to vendors to limit contact of people as part of measures to curb the spread of the virus. On Sunday, President Mnangagwa extended the national lockdown to May 3 as part of measures to fight the spread of Covid-19. The lockdown, which started on March 30, was meant to expire at midnight on Sunday The department of Agritex generates the official letter to individual farmers and if the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works authorises, the farmer is then allowed to go and sell directly to consumers. Market days are Mondays and Fridays only to eliminate uncontrolled movement of people. Farmers now take their produce to the people in areas such as Senga and Mkoba suburbs in Gweru and Amaveni in Kwekwe. The products sold directly to consumers include fresh vegetables, green mealies, potatoes, eggs, broilers and layers. Crop and livestock production provincial officer, Mrs Medlinah Magwenzi, who is the chairperson of the committee on farming and trade, said the move to allow direct trading between the farmers and consumers was meant to eliminate many contacts. In all districts fresh produce farmers are dealing directly with their consumers. Mrs Magwenzi said since farmers were bringing products to the people, the cities and towns no longer had large crowds of people in the CBD seeking to buy farm produce.
