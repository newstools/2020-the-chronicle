After realising that the entertainment industry is likely to be among the last to return to normalcy following the Covid-19 pandemic which has brought business to a halt worldwide, South African rapper, Cassper Nyovest has said he is worried about the future of artistes. Posting on his Facebook fan page earlier this week, Cassper said he was concerned as entertainers, like any other business, have been affected by this pandemic as they have, for the past weeks, been unproductive due to the lockdown and restrictions on movements and gatherings. “Sh** is bad for the entertainment industry right now. I mean sh**s wild for every industry, but we’re at the bottom of the pits and bottom of the priority list. “The private conversations reveal fear for the future and the fear to express how we really feel. Sending you all some light.” He however commended artistes for not losing hope as they, with no benefit, continue to entertain millions of people who are on lockdown through live streams. “Want to send a shout out to every entertainer who did a live stream or put out any kind of content to keep people entertained during this lockdown,” he said. The live streams by the likes of Shimza, DJ Maphorisa, DJ Tira, Black Coffee, DJ Zinhle and Oskido undeniably kept people well entertained as they gave people something to look out for. For this, Cassper said he was grateful as the artistes managed to keep people sane. “I can’t imagine what we would’ve been feeling like being locked in the crib (house) without your songs, performances, live videos and TV and radio. “You bring us healing and help us forget our troubles with your gifts. Thank you!” he said.
