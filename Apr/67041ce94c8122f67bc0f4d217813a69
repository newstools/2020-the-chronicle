More than 600 people have been arrested in the Midlands province for flouting lockdown regulations. The enforcement of the 21-day lockdown has seen heavy police and army presence on all roads leading into the Central Business District (CBD) of Gweru, Kwekwe and Zvishavane among other towns. Drivers and passengers are being asked to produce letters from employers indicating they are part of the skeletal staff reporting for duty during this period. Those without the necessary paperwork are being denied entry into the CBD. Some Members of Parliament and councillors have been issuing exemption letters but these are being rejected by security forces manning roadblocks. Midlands Provincial Taskforce Chairperson on lockdown implementation Brigadier-General Simo Maseko said police have to date arrested 666 people for flouting lockdown regulations. “ZRP are the lead lockdown implementers and the Zimbabwe National Army is there to assist. Since the start of the 21-day lockdown period, 666 people have been arrested for flouting lockdown regulations,”he said. Brigadier- General Maseko said most of those arrested were from Kwekwe city. He said councillors and MPs were not authorised to issue exemption letters hence they were being rejected at roadblocks. “Our approach has been very human but if people don’t heed the call to stay at home, we might be forced to assist them to stay at home,” said Brig-Gen Maseko.
