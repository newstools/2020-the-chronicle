The Chronicle Award-winning artiste Candy “Tsa Mandebele” Mokwena has left record label Kalawa Jazmee. The Tsa Mandebele hitmaker has revealed to Sunday World that she is starting her own independent label called Mosekedi Entertainment. The musician explained that her contract with Kalawa Jazmee ended this year but chose not to renew it as she was ready to release music under her label. “My recording contract with Kalawa Jazmee expired this year. I opted not to renew it due to the fact that I felt I was ready to release music through my own company.” Candy has been part of Kalawa Jazmee since 2009 and has achieved notable success even winning a South African Music Award for Best Traditional Music Album. She has entered into a distribution deal with Sony Entertainment. “I needed help with distributing/licensing my debut album. Before Sony Music Entertainment agreed to partner with me through Mosekedi Entertainment, negotiations with other labels fell through as what was offered was not good at all,” Candy explained to the publication. The artiste has assured that she did not leave the Oskido and Don Laka founded record label on a sour note. Candy’s first independent album, Still Here is set to be released on April 10 and will consist of ten tracks.-Zalebs.
