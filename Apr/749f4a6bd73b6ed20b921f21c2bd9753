LONG distance runner Isaac Mpofu says he has had to adjust his training schedule during the current 21-day coronavirus lockdown. Mpofu is one of the country’s athletes fighting to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic Games that have been rescheduled to 2021 due to the Covid-19 global pandemic. Mpofu, Ethel Sibanda and Ngonidzashe Ncube were scheduled to compete in the Enschede Marathon this month, while Munyaradzi Jari was set to take part in the Hannover Marathon, but both events, which served as Olympic qualifiers, were cancelled owing to the effects of Covid-19. Rescheduling of the Olympic Games now gives athletes another shot at qualifying for the event and more time to prepare, depending on when coronavirus will be contained. “I believe this is a phase that will pass. We must all comply with the Government’s directive to stay at home. I’m focusing on jogging and a bit of gym work to keep myself in good shape. “Hopefully this situation ends early and the situation gets back to normal soon. Obviously, the rescheduling of the Olympic Games is good news for us because it gives us an opportunity to take part in more qualifying events,” said Mpofu. — @innocentskizoe
