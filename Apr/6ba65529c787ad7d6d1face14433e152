The Chronicle Pearl Thusi after almost a month of being away from the social streets has returned. Only time will tell if the actress is back for a long time or just a short period. Pearl without giving a warning to her fans deactivated her social media accounts, raising eyebrows amongst her fans. Her bestie DJ Zinhle even gave Pearl a public dedication message on Twitter during her MIA days letting her know that everything would be okay. The Queen Sono actress returned on Tuesday to announce that her Netflix show Queen Sono has been renewed for a second season. Pearl’s return to the social streets has been welcomed with warm hands by her fans and they have made sure to show her love. Meanwhile, Filmmaker Mmabatho Montsho yesterday took to Twitter to clarify that she is not behind the Twitter account @Mmaps_ThePro, which has her as its profile picture. The Twitter account @Mmaps_ThePro is known for stirring drama and sharing controversial thoughts and not everyone is aware that the actress is not the one tweeting. Mmapula yesterday shared her two cents on Nomzamo’s heartbreak, saying that the former Isibaya actress is a “child” and that she would get to “our level one day”. The former Generations actress must have caught wind of Mmapula’s latest tweets as she asked to be left out of the “other conversation”.- Zalebs.
