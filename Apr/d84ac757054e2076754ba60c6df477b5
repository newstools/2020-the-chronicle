Up-and-coming South Africa-based Plumtree born hip hop musician, C4 has been featured on GP MaOrange’s Amapiano track. The single titled Imbokodo which was produced by Bulawayo top producer, DJ Skaiva and also features SA’s vocalist, Carol Mbokodo was released online earlier this month. C4 (real name Yusuf Swalehe), a product of Plumtree’s Toundtainment record label said he was exploring other genres as he tries to further penetrate the South African market. “The song (Imbokodo) was something that took me out of my rap music box. I never thought I’d feature on an Amapiano track and I’d like to thank Toundtainment and GP MaOrange for giving me the chance,” said C4. GP MaOrange’s last two singles Intuthwane and Fakalento (whose music video was shot in Bulawayo) won big at the Mzansi Kwaito House Music Awards last year scooping Best Kwaito Single and Best Music Video categories respectively. This was not the first time for GP MaOrange (real name Israel Matseke Zulu), an actor famous for his roles on Yizo Yizo and Gaz Lami, to work with a local. Popularly known as the Ghetto Professor, GP MaOrange two years ago worked with Plumtree musicians, RS and Tsibi on a track titled Fakalento. Commenting on the new single, GP MaOrange said: “I wanted to do something different this time hence I fused some fresh Amapiano sounds to make it resonate with the current trends. I’m a pantsula for life, that hasn’t changed and it came out nicely on this smasher of a song,” said MaOrange. Imbokodo is available on online music stores including Spotify, iTunes and Google Music. MaOrange said the music video is being shot and will be released soon. MaOrange said another Amapiano track titled Testimony is also due to be released.
