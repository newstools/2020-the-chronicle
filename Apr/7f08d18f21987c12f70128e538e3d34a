A TOTAL of 75 Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Bulawayo have applied to Government for exemption from the national lockdown. Although Government has extended the national lockdown measure by a further 14 days to May 3 to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, critical service providers have been allowed to operate. Last week, Government released operational guidelines that SMEs exempt from the national lockdown should adhere to in order to stop the spread of Covid-19. In an interview, Bulawayo Chamber of SMEs Mr Energy Majazi said: “Following the release of the guidelines by Government, a total of 75 applications from SMEs in Bulawayo have come through my office for national lockdown exemption. “We will forward the applications to our parent ministry for consideration.” The guidelines come after Government noted that there were some SMEs that provide essential services to the economy, particularly during this national lockdown period. According to the circular only SMEs under the food and beverages, chemical and detergents, medical supplies, agro-processing, clothing and textiles, leather and footwear, plastics and packaging should apply for exemption. Players in the above sub-sectors are required to submit applications through their respective business membership organisations such as the Bulawayo Chamber of Small-to-Medium Enterprises for submission to respective provincial parent ministry offices. In the applications, the SMEs are required to indicate their prevention plan looking at ensuring that only critical staff report to work as well as practising social distancing. Meanwhile, a total of 1 200 SMEs in Bulawayo have applied for a cushioning package that Government has announced would be disbursed to vulnerable groups in order to cushion them from the adverse effects of the national lockdown. — @okazunga
