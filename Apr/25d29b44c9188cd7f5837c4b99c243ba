The Chronicle ASTON Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba has, rather bizarrely, been linked with a move away from the club in the coming summer transfer window, with reports in Turkey claiming that the Lions have given the player the ‘green light’ to join Trabzonspor. Nakamba, who only arrived at Villa Park last summer, signed a five-year deal when joining from Club Brugge and began the campaign brightly.
Performances took a dip in the autumn and winter time, but the Zimbabwe star has since rediscovered his form and was particularly impressive in the Carabao Cup final defeat to Manchester City last month. He’s come in for plenty of praise from boss Dean Smith in that time, too, as the boss has looked to get the best out of his midfield, which also involves options like Douglas Luiz and Danny Drinkwater. The link with a move to the Turkish Super Lig after a single season, then, is an especially strange one; Nakamba, who is 26, has shown signs of adapting to life in England, and specifically the Premier League so the idea of letting him go after a single campaign doesn’t add up. Turkish outlet Fotomac claim that Nakamba is on Trabzonspor’s shopping list and that they hope that the lure of Champions League football will be enough to tempt the midfielder into leaving Villa Park. Trabzonspor are on the lookout for a new holding midfielder after former Chelsea and Middlesbrough star John Obi Mikel terminated his contract recently because of the coronavirus pandemic. Left field links such as this one suggests the transfer silly season might not be too far away. – Birmingham Mail
