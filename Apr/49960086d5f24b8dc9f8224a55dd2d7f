ESROM Nyandoro will keep his football memorabilia after a bidder, who chose to remain anonymous, underwrote the auction for an undisclosed amount after being touched by the sentimental value the Warriors’ legend attached to items meant to go under the hammer. The auction should have been held on Monday evening via Nyandoro’s Instagram page to raise funds for the one million mask campaign in aid of the fight against Covid-19. Nyandoro had offered the national team jersey he wore in the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Tunisia when the Warriors made their maiden appearance as well as the boots he put on when the Warriors took on Ghana in the 2006 Afcon finals in Egypt. The Warriors beat Ghana 2-1 through an own goal by Ahmed in the 60th minute and Benjan Mwaruwari eight minutes later. The Black Stars got their consolation two minutes into injury time through Adamu. Some Mamelodi Sundowns jerseys he wore during his illustrious 11-year career with the Brazilians were also set to go under the hammer with the money going to the #onemillionmaskandsanitersforZim campaign. For the Warriors’ jersey, participation was to be by invitation and they’d have paid a US$1 000 participation fee, with the minimum bid pegged at US$10 000. For the boots and Mamelodi Sundowns jerseys, participants would have paid a participation fee of R1 000, with the highest bidder getting the jersey or boots. “An individual undertook to underwrite the auction for an undisclosed fee. Details will be availed to the public at a date to be advised. The underwriter believes the items are too sentimental and would rather win the auction and gift the memorabilia back to Esrom,” said auction organisers’ spokesperson Vimbai Musvaburi. Speaking ahead of the auction, Nyandoro had indicated that although the memorabilia was priceless to him, he valued the reason for parting with it more than anything else.
