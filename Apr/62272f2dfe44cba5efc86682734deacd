MOSI-oa-Tunya High School in Victoria Falls, which has been turned into an isolation centre for Zimbabweans returning from Botswana and Zambia as part of measures to curb the spread of Covid-19, last Friday received three deportees. It now holds eight people after the first group of five arrived last Wednesday. The five women and three men have been housed in two separate classrooms after being screened for the coronavirus at Kazungula Border Post. Authorities said they will be accommodated at the isolation centre for 14 days. Matabeleland North Provincial Social Welfare officer Mr Macnon Chirinzepi said all the deportees from Botswana and Zambia will be quarantined at the school which can accommodate up to a 100 people. Social Welfare department will be catering for their welfare with the help of other stakeholders including the private sector while police and the Zimbabwe National Army will provide security. “Mosi-oa-Tunya was identified as the quarantine centre for those deported through ports around here. “We have managed to mobilise most of the basics they will need such as food, toiletries, blankets and some clothes,” he said. The deportees are from Victoria Falls, Hwange, Binga and Kadoma. — @ncubeleon
