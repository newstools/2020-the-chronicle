REIGNING Zifa Southern Region Division One League coach of the year Try Ncube has been left frustrated by the ban on all sporting activities as the world continues to fight the spread of the deadly Covid-19. Ncube led Bulawayo City FC to promotion into the Premier Soccer League after clinching the Southern Division One League title before quitting at the beginning of the year to join Victoria Falls-based Mosi Rovers. He replaced Mehluli Moyo, who was coaching Mosi Rovers on a voluntary basis following the departure of Gift Lunga Jr. Ncube had, when Covid-19 hit the country, just completed assembling a side he was confident would challenge for the league title. “It’s very frustrating. We gave boys some individual training programmes, but we can’t make follow-ups and check-ups to see if they are really training at home. It’s a very weird situation, but under these circumstances the players’ lives and health come first. At the moment what is of concern is not football, but the everyone’s health,” Ncube said. “We are all in a difficult situation. It is our hope that we get this whole situation behind us and get back to playing football.” Zimbabwe has so far recorded 11 cases of Covid-19, which have resulted in three deaths. – @innocentskizoe
