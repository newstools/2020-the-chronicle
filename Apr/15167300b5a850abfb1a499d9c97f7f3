The Chronicle Edward Mundete Muchengeti DISRUPTION of supply chains due to the effect of the Coronavirus has left us with one very striking reality. We can not assure ourselves of security on the premise of that we are in the global village. One fact has been demonstrated time and again that we need to think globally but act locally. We are now faced with critical shortages of everything, sanitisers, medicines, water treatment chemicals and face masks to name a few. What we have witnessed is the fragility of a supermarket economy. It is also a wake up call for us to jumpstart our production facilities. <img class="alignnone wp-image-492931 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/IMG-20200323-WA0040.jpg" alt="" width="674" height="445" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/IMG-20200323-WA0040.jpg 674w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/IMG-20200323-WA0040-360x238.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /> Zimbabwe is blessed with intellectual property or an educated populace, which can quickly adapt to the changing situations. We have the capacity to turn around the tide and become a supply power house for the region. It does not take long for an organised nation to do so. We have already demonstrated that in the supply of hand sanitisers and more can be done in other areas of need. The simple idea is we have to begin our journey with what we have in our hands. It is quite interesting that our solutions are not very far from us if we collaborate and standardise our systems. In the face of adversity we see what cooperation can produce. The long sought for cooperation between industry and academic institutions has been kick started and it is my prayer that this fire does not die out with the going out or passing of this pandemic. As a nation we have been importing a whole lot of substances, which are not necessary, substances which can be locally produced. Yes we have to be fair to our regional counterparts but it does not make sense for us to be importing such things as liquid detergents, which we know are 90 percent or more just water, importing things like toothpicks, pins, and many other formulations that can be done locally and improve our well being whilst at the same time creating employment for our graduates. <img class="wp-image-419353 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Deputy-Minister-Raj-Modi-tour-680x397.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="397" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Deputy-Minister-Raj-Modi-tour.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Deputy-Minister-Raj-Modi-tour-360x210.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Merry Birds managing director Mr Samuel Dube stresses a point to Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Raj Modi while Tierra Chemicals managing director Mr Edward Muchengeti looks on during a tour of the company in Bulawayo in this file photo. â€” Picture by Eliah Saushoma Tierra Marketing in this regard is coming up with a range of detergents and cleaning agents, which will go a long way in saving our scarce foreign currency whilst at the same time assuring our population of quality products and creating meaningful employment for our region and country. That is exactly what our Sunklin range does. We have sanitisers, liquid soap, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, chloride of lime, which are our own local formulations. Apart from this we have a team of qualified chemists, which can help you sanitise your premises at affordable costs. We are very much aware of the dangers posed by not using appropriate technology and manpower to solve ongoing problems. We also participate in our society as part of social responsibility by donating much needed resources to critical public institutions and also advising on the best way forward when faced with problems that need expertise of a chemical and practical nature. We strongly advocate that we build ourselves by buying local brands and also by ensuring that our production systems and factories start to function. Lets think globally but act locally.
