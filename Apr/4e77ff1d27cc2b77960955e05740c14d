A TOTAL of 16 321 people have been arrested countrywide for violating Covid-19 orders since the beginning of the lockdown on March 30. Statistics obtained from the Police General Headquarters show that Bulawayo still tops the numbers with 3 973 arrests followed by Manicaland Province at 23 285 arrests. Harare comes third with 2 049 arrests while 1 702 people were arrested in the Midlands province. In Mashonaland West 1 466 people were arrested while 565 were arrested in Mashonaland Central. Matabeleland South has 1 102 arrests while Matabeleland North province has 785. In Mashonaland East province 589 people were arrested and 698 were arrested in Masvingo. The Support Unit separately arrested 107 people countrywide. When the Chronicle went around the city yesterday, most people continued to operate in a ‘business as usual attitude’, with more violating the lockdown which is expected to end on May 3. People in bank queues and remittance centres continued to disregard the social distancing . In a telephone interview, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said police were trying to establish the reason behind Bulawayo and Manicaland provinces’ high arrests figures. – @andile_tshuma.
