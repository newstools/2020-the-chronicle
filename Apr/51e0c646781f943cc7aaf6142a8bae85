ZIFA Southern Region Division One side Arenel coach Kudzayi Mhandire has urged players to take responsibility and follow their allocated training programmes during the 21-day lockdown. Most clubs in the country have prescribed individual training programmes for their players to keep them fit during the lockdown. Mhandire emphasised the importance of players keeping fit during this period. “Hopefully they are following programmes given to them because it is difficult to track if the players are following them. “These are trying times, it’s a pity this came at this time. This is a pandemic and there is not much we can do about it. The break affects our plans because we had covered ground in pre-season, a stage in which as a coach you break it down into three phases,” said Mhandire. “The first being the stage where you choose players, then you work on the physical aspect of the players then lastly the technical aspect of the game where you want the players to use the right techniques.” Arenel were in the process of team shaping and conditioning of players when the lockdown was declared. When the lockdown and bans on gatherings are lifted, Mhandire said they’ll start all over again. — @innocentskizoe.
