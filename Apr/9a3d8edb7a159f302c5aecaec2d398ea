The Youth For Innovation Trust (YIT) in Zimbabwe and Zambia-based World Smash Poetry organisation have partnered on an online poetry contest that will be on tomorrow in commemoration of the World Creativity and Innovation Day. World Creativity and Innovation Day (#WCID) is a global United Nations Day celebrated annually on April 21 to raise awareness around the importance of creativity and innovation in problem solving with respect to advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, artistes have had to be creative and innovative thereby giving a meaningful description of this year’s commemorations.
YIT managing director, Thando Gwinji said the online gathering will bring together poets from across the continent. He said the event will be premiered on the YIT Facebook page tomorrow from 2pm. It will run under the theme “Creativity in a time of crisis taking into consideration the lockdowns and curfews in most African countries”.
Gwinji said the response from poets has been overwhelming. “We sent out an open call to artists across the continent and we received great responses from some of the best poets in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Sierra Leone and Botswana. “We’re looking forward to more countries coming in as we’re not limiting the number of entries because we expect at least each of the African regions to be represented so that we have an inclusive outlook on African realities in crisis,” said Gwinji. – @mthabisi_mthire.
