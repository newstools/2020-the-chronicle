GWERU City Council is working with Government on a smart city design for informal traders who will operate from Kudzanayi long distance bus terminus as well as the new Mtapa market adjacent to Mtapa cemetery. Under the smart city design, only traders selling refreshments will remain at Kudzanayi long distance bus terminus which will have smart ablution facilities. Traders selling other commodities such as clothes and fresh produce will be moved to Mtapa market. The council has since removed illegal structures at the terminus where more than 3 500 traders used to operate from as it moves to clean up the city. Some of the traders were occupying parking bays making it difficult for long distance buses to use the terminus. Work on ablution facilities and vending stalls at both Kudzanayi long distance bus terminus and Mtapa market is expected to start soon. In an interview yesterday, Gweru Mayor Councillor Josiah Makombe said the city was taking advantage of the lockdown to implement the smart city concept. Cllr Makombe said plans were also underway to renovate other vending markets in Gweru to cater for residents in other suburbs. “Government has assured us that they will assist us to implement this project meant to spruce up the city”, said Cllr Makombe.
