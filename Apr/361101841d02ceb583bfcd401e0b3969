ONE of Bulawayo’s football development hubs, Zifa Southern Region Division One League side Ajax Hotspurs have embarked on a rebuilding exercise after losing six key players ahead of the 2020 season. The Mpopoma-based side, which had a hand in shaping some of the country’s notable stars, who include national team left-back Divine Lunga, who now plies his trade in the South African Premiership for Golden Arrows, Highlanders central defender Peter Muduhwa, FC Platinum central midfielder Denzel Khumalo and Highlanders’ wingback Mbongeni Ndlovu, took a swipe at clubs that raided its camp and left them “depleted”. Ajax lost 23-year-old defender Menelisi Ndlovu, the midfield pair of Hillary Moyo (23) and Tanaka Hove (26) as well as the striking trio of 20-year-old Reason Sibanda, Musa Phiri (23) and Keith Miti (23) to Arenel Movers. The players were vital in Ajax’s 2019 campaign that saw them survive relegation, finishing ninth with 35 points ahead of well-funded clubs such as Casmyn, Mainline, Mosi Rovers, army side Motomoto and Arenel Movers. Ajax director Siphambaniso Dube said his club is considering claiming compensation fees from clubs that took their players to sustain their development programmes. “I think it’s only fair that teams that fish from our pond pay us development fees so that we remain viable and continue producing players. “We are strongly considering filing for compensation fees because that is enshrined in Fifa statutes. As it is, we lost a number of players and we are starting afresh. Every year we lose players,” said Dube. He, however, said the positive side of the loss was that the departure of the players gave an opportunity for other youngsters to shine. Ajax will use mostly Under-20 players, with 18-year-old striker Kelvin Chigonero tipped to shine. — @ZililoR.
