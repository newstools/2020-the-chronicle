With people still on lockdown with an appetite for local content, Indlalifa — The Heir, an exciting situational comedy is a show they may want to binge watch on YouTube. The show premiered on ZBCtv last month with producers uploading its seven episodes on YouTube recently for those who might have missed it on the national broadcaster, to watch during lockdown. Although the production which teaches people about abuse, inheritance and tradition is predominantly in isiNdebele, there are subtitles for people to follow if they cannot understand the language. It is about siblings who lost their rich father. They are forced to move into the family’s main house as their father’s requires them to do so in order for them to access all their possessions. After their father’s burial, Liyanda — Liya (played by Michelle Mabuza) and Squint (played by musician Tebza) who were already staying in the main house thought they were going to have a time of their lives with the family house workers Elphina (Paulla Paloma) and Comrade Zamba (Clinton Ndlovu). They had no idea their father had several kids who would move in with them. It all gets dramatic when Baya (played by Prince Lupahla), their father’s first son, surfaces to claim his position as the heir. Sadly for the producers, they can no longer produce more episodes because of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions on movements and gatherings.
