Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the Umahlekisa Lockdown Stand-up Comedy show that was set to take place this past weekend and shown online, had to be postponed after the comedians had difficulties accessing the show’s venue in Hillside. The comedy show was supposed to feature Ntando Van Moyo, Nomsa Dee, Babongile Sikhonjwa, Mandla Da Comedian and Zwe. However, due to police and army presence on the roads, the comedians could not access the venue as only those providing essential services are being permitted to move around. Umahlekisa Comedy Club director Ntando Van Moyo said: “Unfortunately, due to movement restrictions, we couldn’t get all our acts to the venue and as such, we postponed the live stream to this Friday (on condition that the restriction on movements will have been lifted). The jokes will be more massive then,” said Van Moyo. Umahlekisa comedy club which has given a lot of comics a platform to shine, was supposed to celebrate its seventh anniversary last month but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, they had to shelve the plans. They however hope to celebrate once things normalise.
