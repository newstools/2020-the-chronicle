SOUTH Africa-based Bulawayo maskandi artiste Mehlokazulu (real name Sebenzani Mngqolo) has come up with a sizzling single on Covid-19 titled Corona. The adept artiste recorded the song which features poet Bongani (Bongani Ncube from Plumtree) at his home studio. The single is available online while its video is available on the artiste’s YouTube page. Speaking from his base in South Africa, Mehlokazulu said he was motivated to record the single after realising the need to educate the masses about the deadly virus that is killing thousands. “I recorded the song to encourage people to obey the messages relayed by their governments across the world as these are the authorities who’ll guide us and lead us in the right direction. “Owing to the fact that there are a lot of messages circulating on social media which are causing anxiety during the lockdown periods in different countries, the song encourages the public to make use of the mainstream media for the accurate messages,” said Mehlokazulu. He said he partnered Bongani to give the track a fusion of maskandi and poetry. Mehlokazulu urged people to practise social distancing and observe the measures put in place by the World Health Organisation in order to curb the spread of the virus. – @mthabisi_mthire.
