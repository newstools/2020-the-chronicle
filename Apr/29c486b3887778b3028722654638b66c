EIGHTEEN-year-old Street Set FC central defender Linda Maongera can’t wait to get to the field once the Covid-19 lockdown is lifted. Zimbabwe’s sporting community was forced to cancel all its programmes due to the pandemic following an initial 21-day lockdown proclamation by President Mnangagwa, which was extended by 14 days. “While I truly understand and appreciate that it’s for my everyone’s good that we stay at home, I would be lying if I say I am enjoying being home 24/7. It’s frustrating big time, more so without the ball at my feet. I do some training alone, but that spirit when you are training as a team is not there and being alone bores big time. I just can’t wait for the ban to be lifted then we do what we know best,” she said. Maongera joined Street Set last year after writing her O-level examinations at St Jame’s High School. “I felt at home immediately after joining the team; everyone was accommodating, which made it easy for me to adapt and feel comfortable,” she said. Street Set was still playing in the Ladies Amateur Football Association (Lafa) founded by Lee Mangena, who also owns Street Set. The team will be joining the Zifa Bulawayo Division One League when action resumes this year.
