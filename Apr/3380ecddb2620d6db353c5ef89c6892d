ZIFA Matabeleland North vice-chairman Ronald Mhlanga, who died on Friday at the age of 67, was buried at Ingagula Cemetery in Hwange yesterday. In conformity with the Governmentâ€™s directive issued in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the funeral was attended by 50 mourners, mostly family members. One of the pioneers of junior football alongside the late Highlanders legend Barry Daka, Mhlanga commanded a lot of respect in the Hwange community and many will remember him for successfully running the Wankie Amateur Football Association (Wafa) that produced a number of stars, who went on to shine for Hwange FC. Mhlanga is survived by a wife, five children and eight grandchildren.
