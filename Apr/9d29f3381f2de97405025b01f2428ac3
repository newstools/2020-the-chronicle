BULAWAYO still has 10 Covid-19 positive cases as of yesterday, contrary to a Ministry of Health and Child Care report that the province had confirmed an 11th case. Therefore, the national Covid-19 statistics remain at 28 including four deaths and two recoveries. In the Ministry of Health and Child Care daily update released on Friday morning, it was reported that Bulawayo had recorded an 11th Covid-19 case. However, Bulawayo last recorded a Covid-19 positive case on Wednesday last week when five people tested positive for the virus. Acting Bulawayo Provincial Medical Director Dr Welcome Mlilo yesterday said the city still remains with 10 confirmed cases. “It seems there could have been miscommunication regarding that matter. Bulawayo has not recorded a new Covid-19 case meaning we still have 10 confirmed cases,” said Dr Mlilo, in a brief comment. In the daily update statement, Health and Child Care Ministry Permanent Secretary Dr Agnes Mahomva had said the 11th Bulawayo case was recorded on Wednesday. “The Ministry would like to report that of the 101 PCR tests done in the 22nd of April 2020, one was positive for Covid-19. Today, a total of 460 tests were done, giving a total of 5 450 screening and diagnostic tests done to date,” said Dr Mahomva. On Thursday 460 people were screened for Covid-19 across the country with all cases testing negative. Bulawayo had the highest number of tests as 156 samples were done followed by Harare with 70, Matabeleland South was still Covid-19 free with 60 and Mashonaland Central had the lowest number of tests at 11. Dr Mahomva urged citizens to comply with lockdown regulations by staying at home to flatten the curve of the spread of the global pandemic. She said those going out of their homes should maintain social distance. — @nqotshili
