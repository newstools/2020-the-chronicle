Zimbabwe national rugby sevens and Matabeleand Warriors player Nelson Madida has launched an online fitness and health training programme aimed at keeping people in good shape during the Covid-19 lockdown. Driven by the desire to make a difference in society, Madida has come up with an initiative aimed at helping people and fellow sportspersons. “The world finds itself in a difficult position due to this pandemic. The sporting world has suffred severely from the consequence of this virus. However, during this period l have come up with a fitness and health programme meant to keep people focused on something other than the coronavirus,” Madida said. “During this lockdown I’m also hosting a mentorship programme with the youths where we are focusing on topics ranging from self reflection, identity and the influence of new generation on society. All this is being done online.” Madida is following his own home training programme as well as crafting new exercises. — @innocentskizoe.
