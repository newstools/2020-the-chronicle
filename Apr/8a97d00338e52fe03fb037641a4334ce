In a bid to encourage Zimbabweans not to lose hope in the face of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, United Kingdom-based Zimbabwean musician Sithabile Dube has penned 10 singles. Known in music circles as the Ndebele Queen, Dube said she felt compelled to record the singles as she wanted to give her countrymen words of encouragement. “During the lockdown here, I managed to record 10 songs with the hope to encourage people back home to stay strong during the pandemic,” said the Ndebele Queen. She said the singles, which are mostly gospel tunes, are an appreciation of God’s grace despite the pandemic. The Ndebele Queen who was supposed to travel home this year to scout for talent for her band and movie she is working on, said she had to temporarily shelve the plans because of the outbreak of Covid-19. “My dream is to change the arts scene in my country, Zimbabwe. I want to create a bridge between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom through film and music. “Growing up in a white community and being black has a story of its own that needs to be told and I hope to achieve that through working with young Zimbabwean in music and film,” said the Ndebele Queen. Through her philanthropic work, she has taught refugees music and performed at more than 200 open mic nights around the United Kingdom. The talented guitarist who started her musical career in 2004 and left for the United Kingdom a year later, said she had to move to the UK to pursue her musical dream. – @mthabisi_mthire.
