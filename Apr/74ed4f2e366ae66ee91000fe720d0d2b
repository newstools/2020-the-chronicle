The Chronicle GEORGE FOREMAN has begged Mike Tyson to call off his boxing comeback, saying “no more is needed” from the big-hitting heavyweight legend. Iron Mike, 53, recently revealed he is training for a stunning return to boxing amid plans to compete in four-round exhibition fights for charity. But Foreman, who was the oldest world heavyweight champion ever at 45 in 1994 when he beat Michael Moorer, has pleaded with Tyson to keep the gloves off. Foreman, 71, told World Boxing News: “Tyson has done enough great things for boxing. No more is needed. “He is in the Hall of Fame and was a mighty puncher.” Tyson last stepped inside the ring in June 2005 – where he was stopped by Kevin McBride – but recently admitted he might make a return 15 years on. Speaking on an Instagram Live with rapper T.I. he said: “I’ve been hitting the mitts for the last week. “That’s been tough, my body is really jacked up and really sore from hitting the mitts. “I’ve been working out, I’ve been trying to get in the ring, I think I’m going to box some exhibitions and get in shape. “I want to go to the gym and get in shape to be able to box three or four-round exhibitions for some charities and stuff. – The Sun
