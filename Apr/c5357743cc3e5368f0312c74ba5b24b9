CHINESE billionaire Mr Jack Ma’s foundation has made a third medical donation to Africa as it scales up the Covid-19 fight in the continent. The donation was made via the African Union and Africa Centre for Disease Control which is expected to distribute the medical equipment to countries on the continent. The billionaire who made his fortune now in excess of US$40 billion during China’s tech boom by founding the successful online retailer Alibaba has catapulted himself into a global philanthropist with the donations across the globe that include one million masks and 500 000 testing kits to the United States. The latest donation by Jack Ma Foundation will help in strengthening and intensifying surveillance, laboratory testing and case management of Covid-19 in Zimbabwe and other African countries. Among the donated equipment are test kits, ventilators, face shields and thermal guns. Last month, the Chinese billionaire donated 20 000 laboratory diagnostic test kits, 100 000 medical face masks and 1 000 protective suits and face shields to the Government. The foundation also made a second donation earlier this month which includes 500 ventilators, 200 000 suits and face shields, 2 000 thermometers, one million swabs and extraction kits and 500 000 gloves. The continent has approximately 20 000 Covid-19 positive cases including more than 1 000 deaths. Zimbabwe has 25 confirmed cases including three deaths and two recovered patients. The foundation announced the latest donation in a statement posted on micro blogging site Twitter yesterday. “Our 3rd donation to Africa will immediately be made to @_africanunion and @AfricaCDC. This includes 4,6m masks, 500k swabs and test kits, 300 ventilators, 200 000 clothing sets, 200 000 face shields, 2 000 thermal guns, 100 body temperature scanners and 500 000 pairs of gloves,” read the statement. Zimbabwe is among the countries that have benefited from Jack Ma Foundation’s two donations. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, China has been working closely with the Zimbabwean Government in providing support to treat patients, contain and mitigate the effects. China renovated Wilkins Hospital in Harare so that it can isolate and admit Covid-19 critical patients. President Mnangagwa on Sunday extended the national lockdown to May 3 and during the period Government is expected to increase mass testing for Covid-19 cases. — @nqotshili
