INSIZA Rural District Council (RDC) has taken advantage of the lockdown to build a new market at Bekezela Business Centre at a cost of about $1, 4 million in a bid to promote hygiene and sanitation in the area. In an interview, Insiza District Development Coordinator, Mr Zacharia Jusah said the target was to complete the project before the end of the lockdown. He said the new market will have water and sanitation facilities as well as a car park. “Vendors were operating from makeshift stalls outside shops which had become an eyesore hence the council’s decision to build a modern market,”said Mr Jusah. He said the vendors who used to operate from maskeshift stalls will be considered first in the allocation of vending bays. “Council has availed $1,4 million for the project which will accommodate more than 40 vendors,” said Mr Jusah. — @DubeMatutu
