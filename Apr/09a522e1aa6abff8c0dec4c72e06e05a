FOUR Gweru men including a taxi driver have been arrested for allegedly stealing 16 metres of National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) copper cables valued at $13 000. Munyaradzi Chipira (30), Marweyi Munemo (39), Taurai Sibanda (30) and Reputable Thomas Mutonono (24) appeared before Gweru Magistrate Ms Beaulity Dube facing a count each of contravening a Section of the Electricity Act. The quartet was not asked to plead and was remanded in custody to April 30. Prosecutor Mr Pearson Muringani told the court that on April 14, at around 8PM the accused persons together with Webster Majaya and one Vandira, who are still at large, allegedly connived to steal copper cables from NRZ Dabuka Transit yard in Gweru. The court heard that Chipira, Munemo and Sibanda allegedly hired a taxi belonging to Mutonono who ferried them to Dabuka Transit yard in Gweru. The accused allegedly got into the transit yard where they were spotted by NRZ security guards on patrol digging up copper cables. The NRZ security allegedly arrested Chipira and Munemo at the scene while the others fled. The security guards recovered a digger and 16 metres of armoured cables which had allegedly been cut by the accused persons. A report was made at Senga Police Station where Chipira and Munemo implicated Sibanda, Majaya and Vandira. The police made a follow up leading to the arrest of the taxi driver at his home. The stolen armoured cables were recovered.
