THE private sector in Victoria Falls has mobilised resources to set up a Covid-19 isolation centre that authorities say is nearing completion. African Sun and Meikles Hospitality have donated various kinds of equipment to the centre. Stakeholders came up with a Go-Fund-Me campaign spearheaded by the Victoria Falls Covid-19 Taskforce to raise money to buy ventilators and other equipment for the centre. The isolation centre requires four ventilators, beds, linen, nurses and other staffers. So far, they have acquired one ventilator, four beds and several other items. The first confirmed Covid-19 case in the country was of a man resident in Victoria Falls and the patient is said to be still in self-isolation at his house. Hwange District Medical Officer Dr Fungai Mvura thanked the business sector and community for partnering Government. “Work on the first building is complete and we are left with putting equipment. We have managed to get work done with the involvement of the community and we had to do a new septic tank and new geysers at the centre. We have one ventilator and have acquired oxygen equipment,” said Dr Mvura. She said an oxygen synthesiser is already there at Victoria Falls Hospital. Another isolation centre will be opened at Mkhosana Clinic and preparatory work is set to start at the end of the week, added Dr Mvura. The move will ensure that no patients will be transferred to Harare or Bulawayo for testing and management. A ventilator, four beds and several other items have been mobilised through donations and the Go-Fund-Me campaign. — @ncubeleon
