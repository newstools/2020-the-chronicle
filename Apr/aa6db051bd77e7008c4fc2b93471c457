Anglo American’s local unit, Unki Mines has donated R10 million to Gweru Provincial Hospital for the establishment of a provincial Covid-19 isolation centre, the hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr Fabian Mashingaidze has said. Dr Mashingaidze who was briefing the provincial taskforce on Covid-19 which was touring the hospital to assess its state of preparedness said R8 million has been channelled towards the purchase of ventilators while the remainder will be used to buy some materials as well as sprucing up the isolation centre. “Our local mine, Unki Mines has donated R10 million towards the setting up and equipping of a special provincial isolation centre here and from the communication we have been doing with the mine, they have since channelled R8 million towards the purchase of 10 ventilators which will be set up in the isolation centre and this will put us in a better position to deal with cases of Covid-19 in the province,” he said. Dr Mashingaidze said work to establish the 30-bed isolation centre was at an advanced stage at the hospital. He added that they were taking advantage of the Anglo American company’s import documents to facilitate the quick supply of the ventilators for the isolation centre.
