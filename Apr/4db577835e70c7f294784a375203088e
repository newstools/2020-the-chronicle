The Chronicle THERE’S no football happening in South Africa and Kaizer Chiefs’ title hopes have been put on hold, but there is some good news filtering through from the Amakhosi camp. Willard Katsande has once again been a pillar of strength for the Glamour Boys this season, playing a vital role in their march to the top of the Absa Premiership table in their bid to finally end their lengthy trophy drought. Chiefs have lost just one of the 16 league games that the midfielder has played this season, while losing three of the six that he has been unavailable due to either suspension or injury. With that in mind, the 34-year-old’s injury that he picked up against Orlando Pirates will have been a worry for coach Ernst Middendorp given the fact that he was due to miss a handful of their games for the title run-in, though the suspension of the league means that he may not miss any. It is thought that the Zimbabwean hardman has almost made a full recovery from his knee injury that he sustained a month ago, and while he will obviously lack match fitness at this point in time, he should be available for selection by the time the league resumes; if it does. At this point in time it remains to be seen what will happen with the remainder of the 2019/20 season. However, the Premier Soccer League remain confident that they can wrap things up by the end of June. — Soccer Laduma.
