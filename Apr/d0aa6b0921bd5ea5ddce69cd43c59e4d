BULILIMA District has set up isolation rooms at rural clinics to help in the fight against Covid-19, the district medical officer Dr Erasmus Hapanyengwi said yesterday. He said this while receiving infrared thermometers donated to over 10 rural clinics in Bulilima West by the constituency’s legislator Cde Dingumuzi Phuti. The district medical officer hailed the MP for his continued developmental work in the district. “As a district we have a role to play in the fight against this pandemic and to ensure that we play our part. We have identified temporary isolation rooms at all the clinics in the district. The isolation rooms will act as a temporary site where suspected cases awaiting the Rapid Response Team arrival would be kept under surveillance,” said Dr Hapanyengwi. He said rural clinics are faced with shortages of sanitisers, surgical masks and liquid soap. Dr Hapanyengwi said the availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is of critical importance to ensure that health personnel are safe taking into consideration that no Covid-19 testing is done at district level. The district in particular and Matabeleland South province in general have so far not recorded any Covid-19 positive cases. Cde Phuti said his donation comes at a time that Government and the corporate sector should unite in ensuring that health facilities countrywide are prepared to deal with Covid-19. He said rural clinics must not be left out in the fight against the pandemic as they are still offering services to the communities.
