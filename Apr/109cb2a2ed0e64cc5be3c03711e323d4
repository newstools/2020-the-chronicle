BULAWAYO artistes have said although they wish to assist with the rehabilitation of Thorngrove Infectious Disease Hospital and equipping of Ekusileni Hospital which have been earmarked as potential Covid-19 isolation centres in the city, they cannot do so as they are incapacitated. Thorngrove Infectious Disease Hospital is undergoing renovations in order to accommodate Covid-19 patients if the need arises. It is set to attend to mild cases while Ekusileni Hospital will attend to serious cases. Axe-wielding rhumba/tshibilika musician Madlela Skhobokhobo said with artistes incapacitated to fundraise for the pandemic through shows which were banned as a result of the pandemic, those with the financial muscle such as the corporate world, should chip in and donate for a good cause. “As artistes, the way we normally fundraise for anything is mostly through shows and now we can’t hold any thus those with capable pockets, must open their hearts and help. “The virus is affecting all of us as a nation and it’s high time that we work together as a national community,” said Madlela.-@mthabisi_mthire.
