RENOWNED Bulawayo-based boxing trainer Philip “Striker” Ndlovu (65) is appealing for at least US$3 000 to undergo a trans-urethral resection of the prostate (Turp) procedure after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. Ndlovu, credited for nurturing a number of Bulawayo boxers, who include former World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African heavyweight champion Thamsanqa Dube and ex-World Boxing Federation (WBF) Africa heavyweight title holder Elvis “Bulawayo Bomber” Moyo, has had a urinary catheter to help him pass urine since January. The trainer, a popular figure in Bulawayo’s oldest township Makokoba, known for his passion for using boxing to get youngsters off the streets, has also been holding classes at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) arena based ProActive gym. Since insertion of the urinary catheter in January, Ndlovu, who offered free boxing training sessions at Tshaka Youth Centre at Makokoba’s Stanley Square, has struggled to conduct his sessions. Ndlovu appealed to well-wishers to assist him raise funds for surgery. “My passion is boxing and training people boxing techniques. Of late, I’ve been struggling with training sessions after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. It hasn’t been easy coming to terms with this condition and at times the pain is unbearable. I was supposed to go for an operation on April 2, but couldn’t raise enough money for surgery. The quotations that I got in February were equivalent to about US$3 000. I hope my pleas will be heard soon,” said Ndlovu. Those interested in assisting Ndlovu can contact him on his mobile number +263776125390. The US$3 000 will cater for Turp, the hospital bill, imaging, surgical assistant and anaesthetist. – @ZililoR
