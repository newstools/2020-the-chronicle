POLICE in Bulawayo have arrested a six-member youth gang including four juveniles who allegedly broke into a house in Barbourfields suburb and stole a fridge and groceries yesterday. The syndicate comprised two Form 3 pupils both aged 17, two other juveniles aged 17 and 16 as well as Siphamandla Nkomo (20) and Fortune Sibanda (20). They are set to appear in court soon. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube confirmed the arrest and said investigations were in progress. “Police are investigating a case of six youths who were arrested yesterday morning at Barbourfields suburb and are being charged with unlawful entry and theft. “At around 4AM on April 15, a child who was reading next door, heard sounds outside and alerted his father who went out and discovered that his neighbour’s fridge was abandoned in the yard. “The father called the complainant who was not at the house and he went to make a police report as he had suspicions that there was a break-in,” said Insp Ncube. He said the police responded immediately and arrested one of the juveniles who was sitting in a Toyota Granvia some metres away from the house. The suspect was interrogated and he implicated his accomplices but two juveniles ran away, said Insp Ncube. The car was impounded and the suspects admitted committing the crime. “The Granvia car which was being driven by Sibanda was impounded and it was discovered that it belonged to his brother. “The police arrested the escapees a few hours later and they are assisting police with investigations,” said Insp Ncube. The value of the stolen and recovered goods is yet to be ascertained. Insp Ncube thanked the alert child and active participation of his father for alerting police of the crime. He warned criminals that the police are on high alert and would arrest anyone who breaks the law.-@mthabisi_mthire.
