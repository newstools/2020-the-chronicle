UNITED States of America-based former Highlanders and national team captain Thulani “Biya” Ncube says he is safe, but extremely frightened by the Covid-19 pandemic that has so far infected more than 340 000 Americans. The US has recorded about 10 000 deaths due to the pandemic. In Indiana, where the Highlanders’ legend is based, 4 500 people have been infected, with the death toll standing at 127 as of yesterday and this is what’s giving Ncube, the MC United junior football coach, sleepless nights. “Look this is no mean play; this virus is exterminating humankind and it’s really scary. I am safe for now, staying at home as ordered by authorities,” said Ncube. Ncube, who was part of the trailblazing Highlanders’ squad that had many talented players such as Dazzy Kapenya, Bekithemba Ndlovu, Gift Lunga Jr, Sizabantu Khoza, Blessing Gumiso, the late Amon Chimbalanga, Zenzo Moyo, Thabani Masawi, Masauso Phiri, Alexander Phiri and Melusi “Mabaleka” Sibanda, among others, said he spends his time at home researching and exercising to remain fit. “Since this pandemic requires people to stay at home, I am likewise doing the same. At home I watch television and also do some workouts in my gym to stay fit. This has been my template ever since the pandemic became a global concern,” he said. Ncube also runs an academy in Bulawayo, Biya and Friends, that caters for talented youngsters both boys and girls. The academy plays in the Zifa Bulawayo Province League.
